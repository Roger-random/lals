[{"id":0,"href":"/lals/timecards/2026/","title":"2026 Timecards","section":"Timecards","content":" Tuesday 2026/1/20# 2.5 hours total 2.5 facility (52 out of 18) 0 conductor (20.5 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) 2:00PM - 4:30PM (2.5 facility)# Accepted Strawn\u0026rsquo;s invitation to join in signal work today though I only got to participate towards the end as I had an existing eye doctor\u0026rsquo;s appointment. Still, I got to help a bit and learned a lot doing it.\nThe biggest lesson of the day: all my past career skills trying to make sense of poorly documented legacy code built up over decades will transfer directly to making sense of poorly documented track signal wiring built up over decades.\nPast work have not necessarily be done with maintainability in mind, as demonstrated by fasteners only accessible from below. Which today means we would need to pull up the track segment to get to it. They likely built the assembly while laying the track and plopped them into the ground together. Not accounting for the possibility someone may need to service the switch independently at a later date, like today.\nHistory can also be found in wires that today goes nowhere and connect to nothing, trying to tell me stories of projects past.\nI had expected to see major differences between the components I\u0026rsquo;ve used for my indoor electronics projects and track signal equipment out in the elements. Like extensive waterproofing to mitigate corrosion and studious grounding to maintain signal integrity. I didn\u0026rsquo;t see much of that at first glance. I hope I\u0026rsquo;m just overlooking mechanisms I don\u0026rsquo;t yet recognize, but if not maybe it is a contributing factor of signal reliability issues.\nOne thing I am confident of: there will be no shortage of work that needs doing here.\nSunday 2026/1/18# 5 hours total 2.25 facility (49.5 out of 18) 2.75 conductor (20.5 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 facility)# Introduction to track signal system from Strawn. Included some history on both technical and non-technical issues surrounding the signal system.\nCleaned up some of leaves built up overnight on water wheel, then turned on water pump. Watched until I was satisfied the water flow closed the cycle correctly.\nPre-run inspection walk for west track. Rodstein verified. Rock fall is active: a big rock fell on the track in the time between my walk and Rodstein\u0026rsquo;s.\nNo leaf blower on track today because somebody took the bucket of batteries. In hindsight I should have gotten on the radio and asked who\u0026rsquo;s got it. That\u0026rsquo;s what a radio is good for!\n10:45AM - 12:30PM (1.75 conductor)# Safety meeting.\nConductor for Santa Fe Electric engineered by Cook. Handed off to Ames for my lunch break. I took this opportunity to go thank Carolwood staff for being friendly and waving to our guests.\n1:45PM - 2:45PM (1 conductor)# Conductor for Rio Grande UP 1989 engineered by Nelson. A bit of unwelcome excitement in the form of engine derailment at mausoleum when first axle of second bogie went off track. Joked with guests this is an extended tour of rail operations at no extra charge. Needed to disconnect engine from train to put the engine back on the tracks. I learned that a powered slug would have made this particular derailment recovery much more difficult so it was a good thing our engine was not configured as such.\nSeveral pairs of eyes found no plausible explanation for derailment. Engine went through the same location just fine afterwards. Shrug.\nHanded off to Bickel to conduct a train with his family on board. He finished off the day at that post.\nSaturday 2026/1/17# 2 hours total 2 facility (47 out of 18) 0 conductor (17.75 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) 12:30PM - 2:30PM (2 facility)# Stopped in to shovel sediment out from water wheel reservoir so tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s Sunday public run can use the lower outlet pipe instead of filling up the reservoir and spilling over the wall like last week.\nShoveling was easier than the last time I did it, partially because it hasn\u0026rsquo;t built back up as much and partially because I am getting more practiced at it.\nThe dirt is the functional concern, but the buildup of leaves was a secondary appearance concern. I can clear out the dirt but, as the tree is actively dropping leaves every time there\u0026rsquo;s a breeze, clearing out all the leaves is impossible. I can only make it better than it was.\nThick buildup of leaves on the structure before my work, a thin layer of fresh leaves when I called it quits.\nDirt and leaves at reservoir entry under the rail bridge, before and after.\nReservoir dam, before and after.\nMcCabe happened to stop in as I wrapped up my labor, he reviewed and approved of my results.\n3:15PM - 4:00PM (0.75 facility not counted)# Tried to improve appearance of old table saw without success. Not counting this wasted time.\nSunday 2026/1/11# 4.25 hours total 3 facility (45 out of 18) 1.25 conductor (17.75 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 facility)# Track morning walk with leaf blower to clear loose leaves from track. Also removed derailment risks like rocks, branches, and pine cones. Since I had the leaf blower, finish my morning routine by clearing off Sherwood station platform and guest entry area.\nThe water wheel feature is still a bit of a mess after recent rains. I found the grate lifted, implying somebody was in the middle of a project.\n10:45AM - 11:00AM (0.25 conductor)# Train crew safety meeting. Three trains had their engineers and conductors so I\u0026rsquo;m relief conductor on an as-needed bases. Frees me up to go back and look at the water wheel.\n11:00AM - 11:45AM (0.75 facility)# After 11AM and no sign of McCabe, reached out via text message. Received assignment: Reinstall grates, clear out whatever leaves are easy to clean, then activate water wheel. Campbell helped execute this plan.\nIt took a while for water reservoir level to build up to flow over the wall. The pump had to cycle on and off several times before reaching a state of steady flow.\n1:45PM - 2:45PM (1.00 conductor)# Late in the afternoon I conducted Fuad\u0026rsquo;s train for an hour then helped put the bench cars and the engine away at the end of the day.\n3:15PM# Turned off water wheel electric power and water valve. See what the reservoir looks like next time.\nSaturday 2026/1/10# 7.5 hours total 7.5 facility (42 out of 18) 0 conductor (16.5 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) Work day! Good turnout means getting lots done alongside with general meeting people and socializing.\nFollowed up with Paul Boschan about boilers. I should try to get my hands on ASME BPVC section 1. It sets up the basics and also define miniature boiler which applies to scale steam models and locomotives.\n9:00AM - 10:00AM (1 facility)# Work began with a Nelson assigned task: plant some baby Blue Chalksticks (Senecio Mandraliscae) to see how they do. Previous plant experiments got eaten by park animals, hopefully they don\u0026rsquo;t find these as delicious.\nThere are a few more holes in the weed cloth than there were plants. I filled the middle leaving borders around. If these survive, we can either plant more to fill out the perimeter or hope the plants will fill out.\n10:00AM - 12:15PM (2.25 facility)# Next up is a Finch assigned task to rake leaves. I accidentally gathered a crew for this task as Bickel and Chu asked how they can help with work day. Might as well invite them to join me!\nThree people working as a team cleared up leaves built up in front of the two leaf-infested ground level tunnels. We finished up in time for lunch.\nLunch of tasty Mama Bear sandwiches and chatting with club members I have yet to meet.\n1:00PM - 2:45PM (1.75 facility)# After lunch I was assistant for Perez project of setting up radio repeater. There were a few minor misadventures including a lost \u0026amp; found antenna cap but it\u0026rsquo;s nominally up and running. To test range I walked over to Bagley wall while Perez walked to member entrance gate. Sounded really good!\nWith the new repeater antenna active, the old antenna was coiled up. It will be removed later but it stops being a trip hazard now.\nAfter radio project declared a success, took a break to chat with Perez and Chu and Chu (father and son) about trains and the club. For driving large brushed DC motors Perez recommends the Dimension Engineering Sabertooth 2x32 driver\nAfter they departed for home I moved on to my solo project.\n3:30PM - 6:00PM (2.5 facility)# At the board meeting Suncin asked for volunteers on several projects, I signed up to remove rust from the old table saw. Suncin specified Merryland Strip Disc for the job so I bought a pack and had it along with my angle grinder ready in my car. I brought them to the rusty table saw surface.\nThe rust was more advanced than I had thought. It had grown beyond light surface rust to having a pretty hardy black layer. The strip disc was up to the task of removal but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as gentle as I hoped it would be. While better than a steel wire brush, it still left swirls of a rotary power tool at work. Nevertheless, the top flat surfaces are now rust-free. The two guide channels and the guide bar itself are still rusty, as the Merryland disc isn\u0026rsquo;t the right shape to address those items.\nThis was a good place to pause, as I\u0026rsquo;ve maxed out the daily work hours limit. I found a quart of random motor oil in a cabinet. I applied a thin coat to keep rust from immediately returning while I think about what to do next.\nSunday 2026/1/4# 1.0 hours total 1 facility (34.5 out of 18) 0 conductor (16.5 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) 9:00AM - 10:00AM (1.0 hrs facility)# No public rides today due to rain, but stopped in to walk around the track in reverse direction from what I\u0026rsquo;ve been used to so far. Trying to imagine what I would watch for to ensure passenger safety. No leaf blower today, but I did pick up large branches as I went along.\nWalking down mountain division eastward from water wheel, my left foot found a sinkhole collapsing to nearly my knee. Thankfully I did not twist my ankle.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a picture showing its location relative to train storage barn.\nThe hole is immediately above a water drain hole. Looks like dirt has been draining out of that hole along with water.\nTo ensure my good intentions won\u0026rsquo;t end up being counterproductive I consulted with Nelson via text message. After confirmation I\u0026rsquo;m good to go, I grabbed a shovel and filled the hole back up with dirt conveniently at hand.\nSince it\u0026rsquo;s raining, things are still muddy. Will need to revisit after it has a chance to dry and settle, but at least now it presents no risk to anyone else\u0026rsquo;s ankles.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/lals/timecards/","title":"Timecards","section":"The Grand Plan","content":"2026# Started the year with a little bit of probationary period requirements left to finish.\n2025# Applied to join LALS and start getting oriented with what happens behind the fence.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/lals/timecards/2025/","title":"2025 Timecards","section":"Timecards","content":"Sunday 2025/12/28# I thought I would complete probationary requirements today but when I double checked records I found I double-counted conductor hours on 12/7. So instead of a few hours over, I\u0026rsquo;m actually a bit short. I made this mistake because I had been writing down name of the engineer of train I was conducting. This system broke down when Ronne and Rodstein traded off engineering Santa Fe Electric on 12/7. Which meant my \u0026ldquo;conductor for Ronne\u0026rdquo; hours and \u0026ldquo;conductor for Rodstein\u0026rdquo; hours were actually the same hours. Lesson learned, note-keeping system will evolve!\nMorning walk found a broken sprinkler cap just east of covered bridge. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t find matching broken pipe. Informed Nelson and Harper, Harper says he\u0026rsquo;ll look into it.\nTook Santa Fe Electric for a no-passenger full lap under Cammarata supervision. I will need to study signals further and get more experience watching the points on switches.\nLunch options tamales or skirt steak.\nJay Leno stopped by with Doble E-20 steam car and filled up on boiler water.\nActivity# 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 hrs facility) Leaf blower ticket/line area and train platform. Leaf blower on track. Track walk. Still learning, Rodstein found stuff I missed. 10:45AM - 11:00AM (0.25 conductor) Safety meeting for all train crews. 11:00AM - 3:15PM (4.25 hrs - 0.5 hrs lunch = 3.75 kitchen) Restock cold drinks. Help serve lunch. Wash dishes. 3:15PM - 3:45PM (0.5 conductor) Cammarata summed me to conductor for Nelson\u0026rsquo;s train because Rodstein needed to leave. 3:45PM - 5:00PM (1.25 facility) Assist 6-month task of reversing cars Tally# 7.5 hours total 3.00 facility (33.5 out of 18) 0.75 conductor (16.5 out of 18) 3.75 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) Sunday 2025/12/21# Christmas themed day along with Carolwood (Disney) barn. We had Santa, we had Grinch!\nMurphy brought Baofeng configuration equipment and set me up so I can use my own radio.\nMet another Roger. T and C sounded too similar over radio, though, so I pronounced my last name instead of just initial.\nShawn brought and ran a Roger Goldmann (of original livesteamlocomotives.com) designed 2-8-0 steam locomotive pulling public rides.\nBoschan brought and ran a small steam locomotive that fit in the trunk of a Honda Civic, a reassuringly accessible size! Boschan works professionally in a heat exchanger fabrication company, and offered to answer questions about building boilers when I reach that point. The little locomotive is an articulated 2-4-4-2 modeled after the Columbia River Belt Line 7 a.k.a. Skookum\nActivity# 8:45AM - 10:45AM (2.0 facility) Water wheel mesh cleanup \u0026amp; startup Leaf blower ticket/line area and train platform. Leaf blower on track.

Tally# 5.5 hours total 2.5 facility (30.5 out of 18) 2.0 conducting (15.75 out of 18) 1.0 kitchen (4 out of 6) Saturday 2025/12/20# Stopped by for a bit of yardwork, make things more presentable for Disney weekend. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be a busy day. Kallgren said I just missed Jay Leno and his Chrysler Turbine car by less than 15 minutes. That would have been awesome. Ah well.\nKountry Kitchen seating area was getting pretty cluttered with pine cones and needles. Somebody needs to clean it up and today that somebody is me.\nSimilar buildup around the adjacent caboose.\nRinsed off Carolwood driveway. Better but still not mud-free.\nActivity# 1:30PM - 4:30PM (3.0 facility) Leaf \u0026amp; pine cone/needle cleanup Kountry Kitchen Kountry Kitchen seating area All around adjacent caboose Sherwood station (even if I had to do it again next morning it\u0026rsquo;ll be easier.) Tally# 3.0 hours total 3.0 facility (28 out of 18) 0.0 conducting (13.75 out of 18) 0.0 kitchen (3 out of 6) Monday 2025/12/15# Joined Nelson work crew to finish up Bagley wall project. After that, helped to set new metal posts to replace wooden ones on a rail side billboard that has rotted and toppled.\nUnder Nelson supervision, operated the center cab (a.k.a. work train) for about half of east loop. My first time engineering a locomotive, exciting!\nLearned the nearby Habit burger is a common lunch spot by joining for lunch afterwards.\nActivity# 9:00AM - 12:30PM Put horizontal wall logs behind new vertical posts. Refill dirt behind wall. Clean up work site. Remove broken rail side billboard. Drill holes for new vertical posts. New posts in concrete. Clean up work site. Tally# 3.5 hours total 3.5 facility (25 out of 18) 0.0 conducting (13.75 out of 18) 0.0 kitchen (3 out of 6) Sunday 2025/12/14# Murphy instructs me to send text reminder about Baofeng configuration equipment next Saturday evening. Today my train engineer had an extra radio I could use so I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to check out a club radio.\nLiz ran her Allen 2-6-0 Mogul steam locomotive around the track during public run hours. Guests were entertained. Towards the end of the day shortly after our public train left the station, we ran parallel to her train climbing up towards Davis mine. I had a clear view through her locomotive running gear and can see Stephenson valve eccentrics working away. Oh yeah! THIS is why I am here!\nActivity# 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 facility) Water wheel mesh cleanup \u0026amp; startup. Leaf blower cleaning around Sherwood station. Sherwood station umbrella raising. 10:45AM - 4:00PM (5.25 - 0.5 lunch = 4.75 conducting) Conduct for Blake in Santa Fe Electric. That was a long ass day! We were the first train out in the morning and ran two trains after official 3PM closing. We were the final train assigned to lock west gate. Helped put away Santa Fe Electric. Tally# 7.0 hours total 2.25 facility (21.5 out of 18) 4.75 conducting (13.75 out of 18) 0.00 kitchen (3 out of 6) Sunday 2025/12/07# Whenever I\u0026rsquo;m ready to upgrade from my starter whistle, Ronne recommends Acme Thunderer 58 or Titanic.\nLazarus ran public trains with one of his steam locomotives. This made guests happy and I was happy to see and hear it run.\nLiz fired up her Allen Models of Nevada 2-6-0 Mogul coal-burning(!) steam locomotive but unfortunately some misplaced fire grate rods meant she couldn\u0026rsquo;t run it. Liz was very friendly and answered questions as I watched her go through procedure to shut her engine back down for the night.\nLiz loves the K-27 locomotive, specificially engine 463, and was very excited to hear I\u0026rsquo;m contemplating building Kozo Hiraoka\u0026rsquo;s K-27. Sounds like I\u0026rsquo;ll have an appreciative fan if I go make one a 463.\nSince we were on the topic of favorite locomotives, I expressed my eventual goal is to have a 4-8-4 Northern. Preferably the Santa Fe 3751 but I would not complain about Santa Fe 2926. In response Nick G. answered his favorite Northern was the Southern Pacific 4360. Quick internet search says this is a MT-3 class 4-8-2 Mountain. Did I get the wrong one? Ask Nick later.\nActivity# 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 facility) Water wheel mesh cleanup \u0026amp; startup Heavy pine needle buildup around Sherwood station required broom cleanup Leaf blowered lightweight remainder around Sherwood Raise umbrellas 10:45AM - 3:15PM (4.5 conducting) Conduct for Ronne/Rodstein in Santa Fe Electric 3:15PM - 3:30PM (0.25 facility) Water wheel shut down Lower umbrellas Tally# 7 hours total 2.5 facility (19.25 out of 18) 4.5 conducting (9 out of 18) 0.0 kitchen (3 out of 6) Saturday 2025/12/06# Joined Nelson\u0026rsquo;s Bagley Wall crew in the morning, then stayed around for additional independent facility work in the afternoon. Dorado tri-tip is very tasty, hope I\u0026rsquo;ll get more of it in the future.\nBagley wall work anticipated some roots may have grown behind the wall, but they were far beefier than expected putting up a terrific fight. We even had a few battles where wood triumphed over metal tools. I can see how this growth exerted pressure making Bagley wall lean in.\nAfter the Bagley posts were set in concrete, the big crew had lunch then dispersed. Since I\u0026rsquo;m already here and have time, I looked around at what else I could do by myself.\nThe water wheel reservoir collected quite a bit of sediment after recent storm so I started shoveling them out.\nBefore/after view of the reservoir wall.\nBefore/after view of the reservoir underneath rail bridge.\nWe also had quite a few leaves drop on rail layout. I can\u0026rsquo;t do the whole layout by myself in a day, but I can pick a section and make it better.\nNone of this will last, of course. Mother nature always wins in the end. All we can do is to have it look nicer for a little bit.\nActivity# 8:30AM - 11:45AM (3.25 facility) Bagley wall disassembly Set new vertical posts in concrete 1:15PM - 2:45PM (1.5 facility) Shovel sediment buildup out of waterwheel reservoir 3:15PM - 5:15PM (2 facility) Rake leaves from multilane track adjacent to steaming bays, west of Sutchville station.

Rick\u0026rsquo;s got a Audi TDI with DR GROSS plate. Russ has a big truck and that\u0026rsquo;s not a tow hitch in the back: it\u0026rsquo;s a train coupler. Cool!\nTrees on the west end have started bearing fruit. Not ripe enough for eating but big and heavy enough to droop down within reach of public ride passengers. Several passengers on trains I conducted this past Sunday pantomimed reaching to pick fruit. This is not good. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit sad to waste food but safety is paramount. I lopped off the literal low-hanging fruit to remove the temptation.\nThe driveway leading up to Carolwood barn collected quite the layer of mud during recent storm. I don\u0026rsquo;t like how it looks and I don\u0026rsquo;t think guests will want to walk over caked mud.\nThis is what I could do with shovel and broom. I think I need a pressure washer or something to rinse off the final fine layer. But at least there\u0026rsquo;s no sinking guest shoes into mud anymore.\nActivity# 2:00PM - 4:30PM (Subtract Rick/Russ chat time = 2.0 facility) Lopped off grapefruit tree branches that had grown too close to track. Trimmed other potential forehead-smackers on western end. Shoveled thick (~1\u0026quot;) layer of caked mud out of Disney barn entrance ramp.

Crabbe was very helpful explaining what\u0026rsquo;s going on and why.\nListened to several conductors\u0026rsquo; safety speeches.\nOne ride-along with McCabe conducting.\nI got to see the fabled Engine No. 8, club-owned steam locomotive. Tour by Anthony who just barely missed being able to run it when it broke down nearly a year ago.\nChatted with Eber and Nick G. about 3.5\u0026quot; gauge steam engines. I consider myself properly warned that smaller engines are more challenging to run smoothly due to smaller margins in maintaining proper level of fire and water.\nActivity# 3:15PM - 3:45PM (0.5 facility) Help with end-of-day teardown Lower umbrellas Help put passenger cars away Tally# 0.5 hours total 0.5 facility (6.5 out of 18) 0.0 conducting (0 out of 18) 0.0 kitchen (3 out of 6) Sunday 2025/11/09# Introduce myself to the Kountry Kitchen and start helping out.\nDorado: \u0026ldquo;If you need hours, there is always something that needs doing around here.\u0026rdquo;\nActivity# 1:30PM - 4:30PM Instructed on how to restock cold drinks.
