Whenever I&rsquo;m ready to upgrade from my starter whistle, Richard Ronne recommends
Acme Thunderer 58 or Titanic.
Liz fired up her Allen Models of Nevada 2-6-0 Mogul coal-burning(!) steam
locomotive but unfortunately some misplaced pins meant she couldn&rsquo;t run it.
Liz was very friendly and answered questions as I watched her go through
procedure to shut her engine back down for the night.
Liz loves the K-27 locomotive, specificially
engine 463,
and was very excited to hear I&rsquo;m contemplating building Kozo Hiraoka&rsquo;s K-27.
Sounds like I&rsquo;ll have an appreciative fan if I go make one a 463.">

<p>Since we were on the topic of favorite locomotives, I expressed my eventual
goal is to have a 4-8-4 Northern. Preferably the Santa Fe 3751 but I would
not complain about Santa Fe 2926. In response Nick Guzman answered his
favorite Northern was the Southern Pacific 4360.</p>
