    <meta name="description" content="Objective
Learn what happens during Sunday public ride operations.
Notes
Listened to several conductors&rsquo; safety speeches.
One ride-along with Jim McCabe conducting.
I got to see the fabled Engine No. 8, club-owned steam locomotive. Tour
by Anthony who just barely missed being able to run it when it broke down
nearly a year ago.
Chatted with Eber and Nick Guzman about 3.5&quot; gauge steam engines. I consider
myself properly warned that smaller engines are more challenging to run
smoothly due to smaller margins in maintaining proper level of fire and water.">
