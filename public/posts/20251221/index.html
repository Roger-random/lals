Christmas themed day along with Carolwood (Disney) barn. We had Santa, we had
Grinch!
Murphy brought Baofeng configuration equipment and set me up so I can use my
own radio.
Met another Roger (Taguchi)
Shawn brought and ran a Roger Goldmann (of original
livesteamlocomotives.com)
designed 2-8-0 steam locomotive pulling public trains.
Boschan brought and ran a small steam locomotive that fit in the trunk of a
Honda Civic, a reassuringly accessible size! Boschan works professionally in
a heat exchanger fabrication company, and offered to answer questions
about building boilers when I reach that point. The little locomotive is an
articulated 2-4-4-2 modeled after the
Columbia River Belt Line 7 a.k.a. Skookum">
