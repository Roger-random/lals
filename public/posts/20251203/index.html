Was in the area and had a few hours to spare, stopped in for some facility work.
Met Rick and Russ(?) as they sorted through their inventory in the storage
unit adjacent to elevated Gauge-1 layout. Rick&rsquo;s got a Audi TDI with DR GROSS
plate. Russ has a big truck and that&rsquo;s not a tow hitch in the back: it&rsquo;s a
train coupler. Cool!
