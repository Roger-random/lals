Work towards building conductor hours.
Notes
Plan: After completing conductor training with Andrew Chavez, I came to see if I
can get a few ride-alongs and maybe a check ride.
Actual: &ldquo;You finished the class?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; &ldquo;You passed the test?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, 9/10.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re conducting today.&rdquo;
Normally I would talk to engineers to find out who needs a conductor, but today
is different because of an unexpected shortage of conductors resulted in some
shuffling and reassignment by safety coordinators.">
