[{"id":0,"href":"/lals/projects/","title":"Projects","section":"The Grand Plan","content":"My Projects# Nothing yet - but hopefully soon!\nCandidate Projects# My goal is to build my original designs, but that won\u0026rsquo;t happen immediately. I need to first build my skills by undertaking projects designed by people who had put in the effort to document at sufficient detail to be reproduced by aspiring builders like myself.\nLive Steam \u0026amp; Outdoor Railroading is a magazine whose topical focus is exactly what the title says it is. Among its various types of content, the most relevant to this page are the \u0026ldquo;Construction Serial\u0026rdquo; which are projects shared by people encouraging others to build one for themselves. Project details are given in installments spread across multiple issues. I am now a subscriber and have access to digital back issues dating back to January/February 2016.\nVillage Press Books online store is a consolidated storefront for several magazines including Live Steam \u0026amp; Outdoor Railroading. Some of the construction serials are compiled into books after their publication in LS\u0026amp;OR, usually incorporating feedback from readers and adding supplementary material not found in the original serial.\nKozo\u0026rsquo;s Books is a subset of the Village Press book store listing construction serial compilations of designs by Kozo Hiraoka. Unfortunately, this selection is limited to books currently in print. I had hoped to find his Pennsylvania A3 Switcher book here as it was explicitly subtitled The first project for the beginner. It is currently out of print and eBay auctions have been closing in the neighborhood of several hundreds of dollars. On the one hand, this is a trivial amount considering the money that would be spent on raw metal stock to build the A3. On the other hand, I prefer the physical appearance of the K-27 anyway.\nSteam \u0026amp; Stirling Engine You Can Build is a four-book (so far?) collection, published by Village Press, of introductory thermal engine projects. Several people have recommended that I build a few stationary steam engines before attempting a steam locomotive so I should look into these projects and see if anything catches my eye.\nProjects by Others# Live steam model engines and locomotives have been a hobby for far longer than consumer internet has existed, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t meant every project since then have been documented online. This is a place for me to collect the ones I\u0026rsquo;ve come across.\nQuinn Dunki (Blondihacks) Pennsylvania A3 Switcher Quinn Dunki is building Kozo Hiraoka\u0026rsquo;s Pennsylvania A3 Switcher locomotive and documenting the process on her YouTube channel \u0026lsquo;Blondihacks\u0026rsquo;. Which covers many hobby machining topics beyond building this live steam locomotive.\nNeidrauer 4166 Frisco Mikado is documented as a set of photo albums. Upside: a lot of cool pictures. Downside: not much in the way of technical details like dimensions and theoreticals behind the design implementation. I stumbled into this album when looking into what happens to steel boilers as they age. This locomotive needed a new boiler after the original one corroded away from a decade-plus of operations.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/lals/timecards/2026/","title":"2026 Timecards","section":"Timecards","content":" Sunday 2026/2/8# 4.5 hours today, 10.5 hours cumulative 8:30AM - 1:00PM (4.5 hours)# Arrived at LALS to see the fabled \u0026ldquo;Gold Rusher\u0026rdquo; locomotive out for some maintenance work. It gleamed beautifully in the morning light. I hope to see it choo-choo down the rails at some point in all its shiny glory.\nI grabbed a leaf blower and walked the west loop. Noticed several pieces of rusty debris in close proximity to each other but with no obvious source. All rail within ~4\u0026rsquo; in either direction looks fine to my eyes. Later Kristman identified them as heavily corroded rail tie plates and associated fasteners. I think I would have noticed missing tie plates so where did these come from? Still a mystery.\nThe signal (KAB?) by the curved westbound rail leading to O\u0026rsquo;Brien-Moore bridge was correctly green as expected when I walked past. But later coming back the other way, I happened to look over my shoulder and saw it was red with no train. This may be related to that oddly dual-purposed rail segment B-K2. For the moment I can only report it as a known false red to Strawn and at the safety meeting to Sunday operations train engineers.\nHelped Alexander restock the cold water refrigerator in the ticket booth. Then figured I might as well stay on the theme and went over the Kountry Kitchen beverage cooler as well. Several flats of drinks are now all in the refrigerator, opening up storage shelf space.\nWhile moving bottles towards the front, I found there\u0026rsquo;s something brown and sticky (Coca Cola? Pepsi? Dr. Pepper?) on the bottom. I wiped up the stainless steel, and also bottoms of several cans that were sitting in that stuff.\nSent pictures of updated status (storage shelf, cooler left, cooler right) to Dorado for his information.\nMeeting up with friends for lunch today so departed at 1PM.\nFriday 2026/2/6# 3.0 hours today, 6.0 hours cumulative 11:00AM - 1:30PM (2.5 hours)# Met up with Strawn and Harper by panel K to see why signal light KD is dark. An ultimately unsatisfying session because after probing some panels and wires the light came back on without any intentional change on our part. Intermittent connections make us tear our hair out.\nWhile probing panel K, learned that a segment of rail (B-K2) has an associated train presence detector board for signal purposes AND hooked up to another detector that triggers a timer to control signal panel power. The timer functionality is usually done by a short dedicated length of rail. What are the tradeoffs between using dedicated rail versus dual-purposing like this?\nPanel K is also unusual in having an always-on exhaust fan pushing warm air out of the enclosure. This may be related to the timer board (since it needs to stay on 24x7 to control whether the rest of the panel comes on) or it may be due to the fact this panel gets a lot of sun exposure. New idea for the project to-do list: add a rail side scenery facade building that also act as panel K sun shade.\nWith some lessons learned about panel K and KD illuminated, attention moved on to a rail switch motor control module in panel J. The new module is not an identical drop-in replacement for the old so wiring verification and remapping had to be done first. This was more difficult than it should be, partly due to technical problems like a jumper wire that didn\u0026rsquo;t actually jump, and to non- technical issues like low blood sugar. Fix for the former: different jumper wire. Fix for the latter: get lunch.\n2:30PM - 3:00PM (0.5 hours)# Continue panel J rail switch motor board replacement. Good news: the new board sees user pressing on the rail side pole switch. Bad news: the new board isn\u0026rsquo;t commanding the MOSFET to send power to the motor. Without power the motor doesn\u0026rsquo;t turn and the switch doesn\u0026rsquo;t get thrown.\nI had to be out the gate by 3, Harper and Strawn continued working.\nMonday 2026/2/2# 3.0 hours today, 3.0 hours cumulative First yellow time card as full member!\n1:00PM - 4:00PM (3 hours)# Helped Strawn with signal work.\nOpened up the Sherwood station crossing signal boxes because they aren\u0026rsquo;t doing anything as if they don\u0026rsquo;t have power. Tracing through the power supply board, everything looks to be in order. That\u0026rsquo;s when we noticed the signals are now powered up. Hypothesis: there\u0026rsquo;s an intermittent connection somewhere in the power supply board, and it woke up when we were poking around with a meter. Not fixed, but at least we\u0026rsquo;ve narrowed it down and it\u0026rsquo;s working for now. I guess we can try wiggling the power board the next time it happens.\nMoving on to panel G to diagnose missing red light on the signal bridge. Flipping the light driver board to test mode, we saw it was not even trying to illuminate red. Swapping out the board allowed red light to illuminate. I performed this board swap as my first hands-on signal work and I was supervised by no less than five other people. I feel important.\nNext: why is it trying to show red light when there\u0026rsquo;s no train? Found a busted bond wire to replace and now signal bridge lights show red when there\u0026rsquo;s a train and green when there is not. Success!\nNext up panel H. While waiting for Smith to arrive, probed to find current mapping from rail segments to detector boards. Then consulted with Smith to understand why there\u0026rsquo;s a signal showing red and yellow simultaneously, something that should never happen. Traced electrical behavior through rail and found another bond wire to replace, but light is still showing both red and yellow simultaneously. Smith will look at it some more.\nWhile working on H, Strawn noticed light going up to Mountain Division is indicating a train when there isn\u0026rsquo;t one. This is new behavior within the past few hours. Harper was working in that area in preparation for future work and may have inadvertently damaged a feed wire. Fortunately it was quickly diagnosed and repaired.\n7:00PM Board Meeting# Among various club business, three probationary members were voted to full membership: Syring, Turner, and me!\nSunday 2026/2/1# 1.5 hours total 0 facility (61.25 out of 18) 1.5 conductor (25.25 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) Last orange card as probationary member.\n8:45AM - 10:00AM (No club credit)# Two training laps on Santa Fe Electric with Ronne in the first car going over things as we went. I had to articulate what track signals I see, explain what I think they meant, and what I should do about it (if anything.) Also included a few randomly called whistle stops for me to practice stopping promptly without being jarring. Learning the throttle engagement curve on SFE control knob feel a lot like learning a car manual transmission\u0026rsquo;s clutch engagement zone. Practice makes perfect!\nRonne thinks I\u0026rsquo;m doing very well and on track towards my goal of getting certified as an engineer on club engines for public runs. A good vote of confidence as I work towards fulfilling other requirements.\n10:45AM - 11:00AM (0.25 conductor)# Safety meeting\n12:00PM - 1:15PM (1.25 conductor)# Lunch relief conductor on Santa Fe Electric\nMisc# Plus other minor facility tasks like helping to take out the garbage of Kountry Kitchen. Nothing big enough to track.\nReviewing my photo record of my time card, I realized I forgot to put down my name and today\u0026rsquo;s date on the card. Oops! Thankfully I have more than enough hours to finish out my probationary period and missing these 1.5 hours won\u0026rsquo;t matter.\nTuesday 2026/1/27# 7 hours total 7 facility (61.25 out of 18) 0 conductor (23.75 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) 9:45AM - 1:00PM (3.25 facility)# Joined for a full day of signal work! Started by helping Strawn make panel I talk to panel R so that a red signal in zone I will trigger the appropriate yellow signal in zone R. Learned valuable lesson that these panel connections have isolated ground wires. In hindsight it was something both of us should have known.\nAfter that success, moved on to panel S. I put my familiarity with leaf blowers to work clearing out leaves to help see where wires already existed. Once wires were located and identified, it didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for Strawn and Harper to restore power timer functionality. The timer module needs a bit of programming to make it display a countdown and adjust the time span, this is now on Strawn\u0026rsquo;s to-do list.\nOn the way out to lunch, we noticed false red/red displaying for main line / mountain division. Strawn and Harper agreed that should take priority over what they had on their to-do list for the afternoon.\n2:00PM - 4:45PM (2.75 facility)# After lunch Strawn opened up panel H to see why mountain division has a false red/red. Found several error conditions that led to replacing two broken bond wires and one broken track resistor. Unfortunately the light is still not behaving quite right. Now the signal is green for main line, which is correct, but mountain division light has both red and yellow illuminated even though track voltage levels are consistent with a green. With wiring fixed and voltage correct, the problem is likely somewhere within Smith proprietary analog logic circuits.\nWe also found the both adjacent western blocks are completely unpowered with zero train presence sensing voltage. Thus trains on those blocks are not being tracked by the signal system. This has repercussions beyond today\u0026rsquo;s scope of work, will have to come back later.\nAfter today\u0026rsquo;s session I feel I can do some basic signal issue diagnosis using a voltmeter, looking for 12-16VDC vs. 6-8VDC vs \u0026lt;1V DC. Probably can\u0026rsquo;t fix anything without access to signal panels, but can gather information to help make repairs faster.\nFor next session: bring ferrule crimp kit and bring iPad online with Test Flight for the signal system reference app.\n4:45PM - 6:00PM (1.25 facility)# After Harper and Strawn departed, I went back to my solo project: club\u0026rsquo;s old table saw. I cleaned off the top surface on Jan 10th but the grinder-mounted Merryland strip disc could not get into the pair of recessed guide rails so they remained rusty.\nToday I brought some drill-mounted steel wire wheels that I can use to clean out those slots. Taking care not to (further) mar the top surface with those steel bristles.\nOnce those were clean, I put the guide back into the slot and noticed it was also covered with rust. Good thing I saw it while I have all my tools handy, so I could make it all nice and shiny too.\nAfter applying a coat of oil to keep rust from immediately returning, I am content to call the table saw project done for now. Pending evaluation and feedback for improvement.\nSunday 2026/1/25# 5.5 hours total 2.25 facility (54.25 out of 18) 3.25 conductor (23.75 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 facility)# Lots of leaves dropped on the water wheel feature. Blew and raked three garbage cans worth of leaves for the organics bin while McCabe worked on the debris screen. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t confident I could put it back together so I hadn\u0026rsquo;t taken it apart in my previous work sessions. Today was the first time I could watch McCabe take it apart, shovel accumulated dirt, and put it back together. Now I can handle doing the same the next time I shovel out the reservoir.\nLearned the fine mesh filter looped over the drain pipe exit were nylon sheer knee-high socks. The old one was retired and a new one installed, with a few extras available for the future.\nAfter the water wheel was sorted out, took the leaf blower and walked the west loop. Leaf clearing was easier because Tagochi had already done some of it with a gas-powered blower. Usual rocks and branches, nothing major.\nAs I completed my west loop walk, Rodstein reported a problem with the east loop: rails over a bridge were loose, moving as much as 1/4\u0026quot; laterally which is bad. I join the crew making an expedient field repair to steady the rails for Sunday ride operation. A real fix will be needed later.\n10:45AM - 11:00AM (0.25 conductor)# After safety meeting I was slated to conduct SPPA, but Tagochi needs more conductor hours so I gave up that seat.\n11:45AM - 12:45AM (1.0 conductor)# Santa Fe Electric conductor duty. McCabe handed off to me, and I handed off to (?) at lunchtime.\nLunchtime entertainment# During lunch break, saw Jay Leno stop by with his White (that\u0026rsquo;s the brand name) steam car. Judging by its green color, I guess it is the 1909 Model M featured in this video.\nLove that the thing was designed without an electrical system. Not just lack of electronics: lack of electricity! No spark plugs, no ignition. All lights are acetylene gas burning lamps, including the dashboard instrument light.\nAs he departed he gave us a toot of the horn \u0026ndash; a multi-tone steam whistle, naturally.\n1:30PM - 3:45PM (2.25 conductor)# Resumed conducting Santa Fe Electric engineered by Blake. Continued for the rest of the day including last train of the day duty of locking west gate.\nMiscellaneous# Saw that someone performed the experiment discussed at general member meeting. I cautioned against using vinegar on corrosion concerns. Well, they were right it would kill weeds, and I was right it greatly accelerated rail corrosion. (And probably fasteners, switches, etc.) I stand by my opinion rail condition is an important concern at a train club.\nThe pump house clock has been one hour off for several months, since the time we were supposed to \u0026ldquo;fall back\u0026rdquo;. Alexander helped me adjust the clock so it reads correctly again. That was an adventure but we should be able to do it faster in a few weeks when we \u0026ldquo;spring forward\u0026rdquo;. Afterwards we were told Harrison could do it quickly so I should ask him about it the next time I see him.\nGot a chance to look inside the club library, saw the collection included a few out-of-print titles that I would be interested in digging into later. Including Kozo Hiraoka\u0026rsquo;s Climax and Pennsylvania A3 Switcher books.\nDinner at Tallyrand. They do a solid chicken fried steak.\nTuesday 2026/1/20# 2.5 hours total 2.5 facility (52 out of 18) 0 conductor (20.5 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) 2:00PM - 4:30PM (2.5 facility)# Accepted Strawn\u0026rsquo;s invitation to join in signal work today though I only got to participate towards the end as I had an existing eye doctor\u0026rsquo;s appointment. Still, I got to help a bit and learned a lot doing it.\nThe biggest lesson of the day: all my past career skills trying to make sense of poorly documented legacy code built up over decades will transfer directly to making sense of poorly documented track signal wiring built up over decades.\nPast work have not necessarily been done with maintainability in mind, as demonstrated by fasteners only accessible from below. Which today means we would need to pull up the track segment to get to it. They likely built the assembly while laying the track and plopped them into the ground together. Not accounting for the possibility someone may need to service the switch independently at a later date, like today.\nHistory can also be found in wires that today goes nowhere and connect to nothing, trying to tell me stories of projects past.\nI had expected to see major differences between the components I\u0026rsquo;ve used for my indoor electronics projects and track signal equipment out in the elements. Like extensive waterproofing to mitigate corrosion and studious grounding to maintain signal integrity. I didn\u0026rsquo;t see much of that at first glance. I hope I\u0026rsquo;m just overlooking mechanisms I don\u0026rsquo;t yet recognize, but if not maybe it is a contributing factor of signal reliability issues.\nOne thing I am confident of: there will be no shortage of work that needs doing here.\nSunday 2026/1/18# 5 hours total 2.25 facility (49.5 out of 18) 2.75 conductor (20.5 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 facility)# Introduction to track signal system from Strawn. Included some history on both technical and non-technical issues surrounding the signal system.\nCleaned up some of leaves built up overnight on water wheel, then turned on water pump. Watched until I was satisfied the water flow closed the cycle correctly.\nPre-run inspection walk for west track. Rodstein verified. Rock fall is active: a big rock fell on the track in the time between my walk and Rodstein\u0026rsquo;s.\nNo leaf blower on track today because somebody took the bucket of batteries. In hindsight I should have gotten on the radio and asked who\u0026rsquo;s got it. That\u0026rsquo;s what a radio is good for!\n10:45AM - 12:30PM (1.75 conductor)# Safety meeting.\nConductor for Santa Fe Electric engineered by Cook. Handed off to Ames for my lunch break. I took this opportunity to go thank Carolwood staff for being friendly and waving to our guests.\n1:45PM - 2:45PM (1 conductor)# Conductor for Rio Grande UP 1989 engineered by Nelson. A bit of unwelcome excitement in the form of engine derailment at mausoleum when first axle of second bogie went off track. Joked with guests this is an extended tour of rail operations at no extra charge. Needed to disconnect engine from train to put the engine back on the tracks. I learned that a powered slug would have made this particular derailment recovery much more difficult so it was a good thing our engine was not configured as such.\nSeveral pairs of eyes found no plausible explanation for derailment. Engine went through the same location just fine afterwards. Shrug.\nHanded off to Bickel to conduct a train with his family on board. He finished off the day at that post.\nSaturday 2026/1/17# 2 hours total 2 facility (47 out of 18) 0 conductor (17.75 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) 12:30PM - 2:30PM (2 facility)# Stopped in to shovel sediment out from water wheel reservoir so tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s Sunday public run can use the lower outlet pipe instead of filling up the reservoir and spilling over the wall like last week.\nShoveling was easier than the last time I did it, partially because it hasn\u0026rsquo;t built back up as much and partially because I am getting more practiced at it.\nThe dirt is the functional concern, but the buildup of leaves was a secondary appearance concern. I can clear out the dirt but, as the tree is actively dropping leaves every time there\u0026rsquo;s a breeze, clearing out all the leaves is impossible. I can only make it better than it was.\nThick buildup of leaves on the structure before my work, a thin layer of fresh leaves when I called it quits.\nDirt and leaves at reservoir entry under the rail bridge, before and after.\nReservoir dam, before and after.\nMcCabe happened to stop in as I wrapped up my labor, he reviewed and approved of my results.\n3:15PM - 4:00PM (0.75 facility not counted)# Tried to improve appearance of old table saw without success. Not counting this wasted time.\nSunday 2026/1/11# 4.25 hours total 3 facility (45 out of 18) 1.25 conductor (17.75 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 facility)# Track morning walk with leaf blower to clear loose leaves from track. Also removed derailment risks like rocks, branches, and pine cones. Since I had the leaf blower, finish my morning routine by clearing off Sherwood station platform and guest entry area.\nThe water wheel feature is still a bit of a mess after recent rains. I found the grate lifted, implying somebody was in the middle of a project.\n10:45AM - 11:00AM (0.25 conductor)# Train crew safety meeting. Three trains had their engineers and conductors so I\u0026rsquo;m relief conductor on an as-needed bases. Frees me up to go back and look at the water wheel.\n11:00AM - 11:45AM (0.75 facility)# After 11AM and no sign of McCabe, reached out via text message. Received assignment: Reinstall grates, clear out whatever leaves are easy to clean, then activate water wheel. Campbell helped execute this plan.\nIt took a while for water reservoir level to build up to flow over the wall. The pump had to cycle on and off several times before reaching a state of steady flow.\n1:45PM - 2:45PM (1.00 conductor)# Late in the afternoon I conducted Fuad\u0026rsquo;s train for an hour then helped put the bench cars and the engine away at the end of the day.\n3:15PM# Turned off water wheel electric power and water valve. See what the reservoir looks like next time.\nSaturday 2026/1/10# 7.5 hours total 7.5 facility (42 out of 18) 0 conductor (16.5 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) Work day! Good turnout means getting lots done alongside with general meeting people and socializing.\nFollowed up with Paul Boschan about boilers. I should try to get my hands on ASME BPVC section 1. It sets up the basics and also define miniature boiler which applies to scale steam models and locomotives.\n9:00AM - 10:00AM (1 facility)# Work began with a Nelson assigned task: plant some baby Blue Chalksticks (Senecio Mandraliscae) to see how they do. Previous plant experiments got eaten by park animals, hopefully they don\u0026rsquo;t find these as delicious.\nThere are a few more holes in the weed cloth than there were plants. I filled the middle leaving borders around. If these survive, we can either plant more to fill out the perimeter or hope the plants will fill out.\n10:00AM - 12:15PM (2.25 facility)# Next up is a Finch assigned task to rake leaves. I accidentally gathered a crew for this task as Bickel and Chu asked how they can help with work day. Might as well invite them to join me!\nThree people working as a team cleared up leaves built up in front of the two leaf-infested ground level tunnels. We finished up in time for lunch.\nLunch of tasty Mama Bear sandwiches and chatting with club members I have yet to meet.\n1:00PM - 2:45PM (1.75 facility)# After lunch I was assistant for Perez project of setting up radio repeater. There were a few minor misadventures including a lost \u0026amp; found antenna cap but it\u0026rsquo;s nominally up and running. To test range I walked over to Bagley wall while Perez walked to member entrance gate. Sounded really good!\nWith the new repeater antenna active, the old antenna was coiled up. It will be removed later but it stops being a trip hazard now.\nAfter radio project declared a success, took a break to chat with Perez and Chu and Chu (father and son) about trains and the club. For driving large brushed DC motors Perez recommends the Dimension Engineering Sabertooth 2x32 driver\nAfter they departed for home I moved on to my solo project.\n3:30PM - 6:00PM (2.5 facility)# At the board meeting Suncin asked for volunteers on several projects, I signed up to remove rust from the old table saw. Suncin specified Merryland Strip Disc for the job so I bought a pack and had it along with my angle grinder ready in my car. I brought them to the rusty table saw surface.\nThe rust was more advanced than I had thought. It had grown beyond light surface rust to having a pretty hardy black layer. The strip disc was up to the task of removal but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as gentle as I hoped it would be. While better than a steel wire brush, it still left swirls of a rotary power tool at work. Nevertheless, the top flat surfaces are now rust-free. The two guide channels and the guide bar itself are still rusty, as the Merryland disc isn\u0026rsquo;t the right shape to address those items.\nThis was a good place to pause, as I\u0026rsquo;ve maxed out the daily work hours limit. I found a quart of random motor oil in a cabinet. I applied a thin coat to keep rust from immediately returning while I think about what to do next.\nSunday 2026/1/4# 1.0 hours total 1 facility (34.5 out of 18) 0 conductor (16.5 out of 18) 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6) 9:00AM - 10:00AM (1.0 hrs facility)# No public rides today due to rain, but stopped in to walk around the track in reverse direction from what I\u0026rsquo;ve been used to so far. Trying to imagine what I would watch for to ensure passenger safety. No leaf blower today, but I did pick up large branches as I went along.\nWalking down mountain division eastward from water wheel, my left foot found a sinkhole collapsing to nearly my knee. Thankfully I did not twist my ankle.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a picture showing its location relative to train storage barn.\nThe hole is immediately above a water drain hole. Looks like dirt has been draining out of that hole along with water.\nTo ensure my good intentions won\u0026rsquo;t end up being counterproductive I consulted with Nelson via text message. After confirmation I\u0026rsquo;m good to go, I grabbed a shovel and filled the hole back up with dirt conveniently at hand.\nSince it\u0026rsquo;s raining, things are still muddy. Will need to revisit after it has a chance to dry and settle, but at least now it presents no risk to anyone else\u0026rsquo;s ankles.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/lals/timecards/","title":"Timecards","section":"The Grand Plan","content":"2026# Started the year with a little bit of probationary period requirements left to finish.\n2025# Applied to join LALS and start getting oriented with what happens behind the fence.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/lals/timecards/2025/","title":"2025 Timecards","section":"Timecards","content":"Sunday 2025/12/28# I thought I would complete probationary requirements today but when I double checked records I found I double-counted conductor hours on 12/7. So instead of a few hours over, I\u0026rsquo;m actually a bit short. I made this mistake because I had been writing down name of the engineer of train I was conducting. This system broke down when Ronne and Rodstein traded off engineering Santa Fe Electric on 12/7. Which meant my \u0026ldquo;conductor for Ronne\u0026rdquo; hours and \u0026ldquo;conductor for Rodstein\u0026rdquo; hours were actually the same hours. Lesson learned, note-keeping system will evolve!\nMorning walk found a broken sprinkler cap just east of covered bridge. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t find matching broken pipe. Informed Nelson and Harper, Harper says he\u0026rsquo;ll look into it.\nTook Santa Fe Electric for a no-passenger full lap under Cammarata supervision. I will need to study signals further and get more experience watching the points on switches.\nLunch options tamales or skirt steak.\nJay Leno stopped by with Doble E-20 steam car and filled up on boiler water.\nActivity# 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 hrs facility) Leaf blower ticket/line area and train platform. Leaf blower on track. Track walk. Still learning, Rodstein found stuff I missed. 10:45AM - 11:00AM (0.25 conductor) Safety meeting for all train crews. 11:00AM - 3:15PM (4.25 hrs - 0.5 hrs lunch = 3.75 kitchen) Restock cold drinks. Help serve lunch.

We had Santa, we had Grinch!\nMurphy brought Baofeng configuration equipment and set me up so I can use my own radio.\nMet another Roger. T and C sounded too similar over radio, though, so I pronounced my last name instead of just initial.\nShawn brought and ran a Roger Goldmann (of original livesteamlocomotives.com) designed 2-8-0 steam locomotive pulling public rides.\nBoschan brought and ran a small steam locomotive that fit in the trunk of a Honda Civic, a reassuringly accessible size! Boschan works professionally in a heat exchanger fabrication company, and offered to answer questions about building boilers when I reach that point.

It\u0026rsquo;s going to be a busy day. Kallgren said I just missed Jay Leno and his Chrysler Turbine car by less than 15 minutes. That would have been awesome. Ah well.\nKountry Kitchen seating area was getting pretty cluttered with pine cones and needles. Somebody needs to clean it up and today that somebody is me.\nSimilar buildup around the adjacent caboose.\nRinsed off Carolwood driveway.

Today my train engineer had an extra radio I could use so I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to check out a club radio.\nLiz ran her Allen 2-6-0 Mogul steam locomotive around the track during public run hours. Guests were entertained. Towards the end of the day shortly after our public train left the station, we ran parallel to her train climbing up towards Davis mine. I had a clear view through her locomotive running gear and can see Stephenson valve eccentrics working away. Oh yeah! THIS is why I am here!\nActivity# 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 facility) Water wheel mesh cleanup \u0026amp; startup. Leaf blower cleaning around Sherwood station.

This made guests happy and I was happy to see and hear it run.\nLiz fired up her Allen Models of Nevada 2-6-0 Mogul coal-burning(!) steam locomotive but unfortunately some misplaced fire grate rods meant she couldn\u0026rsquo;t run it. Liz was very friendly and answered questions as I watched her go through procedure to shut her engine back down for the night.\nLiz loves the K-27 locomotive, specificially engine 463, and was very excited to hear I\u0026rsquo;m contemplating building Kozo Hiraoka\u0026rsquo;s K-27. Sounds like I\u0026rsquo;ll have an appreciative fan if I go make one a 463.\nSince we were on the topic of favorite locomotives, I expressed my eventual goal is to have a 4-8-4 Northern. Preferably the Santa Fe 3751 but I would not complain about Santa Fe 2926. In response Nick G. answered his favorite Northern was the Southern Pacific 4360. Quick internet search says this is a MT-3 class 4-8-2 Mountain. Did I get the wrong one?

Dorado tri-tip is very tasty, hope I\u0026rsquo;ll get more of it in the future.\nBagley wall work anticipated some roots may have grown behind the wall, but they were far beefier than expected putting up a terrific fight. We even had a few battles where wood triumphed over metal tools. I can see how this growth exerted pressure making Bagley wall lean in.\nAfter the Bagley posts were set in concrete, the big crew had lunch then dispersed. Since I\u0026rsquo;m already here and have time, I looked around at what else I could do by myself.\nThe water wheel reservoir collected quite a bit of sediment after recent storm so I started shoveling them out.\nBefore/after view of the reservoir wall.\nBefore/after view of the reservoir underneath rail bridge.\nWe also had quite a few leaves drop on rail layout. I can\u0026rsquo;t do the whole layout by myself in a day, but I can pick a section and make it better.\nNone of this will last, of course. Mother nature always wins in the end. All we can do is to have it look nicer for a little bit.\nActivity# 8:30AM - 11:45AM (3.25 facility) Bagley wall disassembly Set new vertical posts in concrete 1:15PM - 2:45PM (1.5 facility) Shovel sediment buildup out of waterwheel reservoir 3:15PM - 5:15PM (2 facility) Rake leaves from multilane track adjacent to steaming bays, west of Sutchville station.

Rick\u0026rsquo;s got a Audi TDI with DR GROSS plate. Russ has a big truck and that\u0026rsquo;s not a tow hitch in the back: it\u0026rsquo;s a train coupler. Cool!\nTrees on the west end have started bearing fruit. Not ripe enough for eating but big and heavy enough to droop down within reach of public ride passengers. Several passengers on trains I conducted this past Sunday pantomimed reaching to pick fruit. This is not good. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit sad to waste food but safety is paramount. I lopped off the literal low-hanging fruit to remove the temptation.\nThe driveway leading up to Carolwood barn collected quite the layer of mud during recent storm. I don\u0026rsquo;t like how it looks and I don\u0026rsquo;t think guests will want to walk over caked mud.\nThis is what I could do with shovel and broom. I think I need a pressure washer or something to rinse off the final fine layer. But at least there\u0026rsquo;s no sinking guest shoes into mud anymore.\nActivity# 2:00PM - 4:30PM (Subtract Rick/Russ chat time = 2.0 facility) Lopped off grapefruit tree branches that had grown too close to track.

Tour by Anthony who just barely missed being able to run it when it broke down nearly a year ago.\nChatted with Eber and Nick G. about 3.5\u0026quot; gauge steam engines. I consider myself properly warned that smaller engines are more challenging to run smoothly due to smaller margins in maintaining proper level of fire and water.\nActivity# 3:15PM - 3:45PM (0.5 facility) Help with end-of-day teardown Lower umbrellas Help put passenger cars away Tally# 0.5 hours total 0.5 facility (6.5 out of 18) 0.0 conducting (0 out of 18) 0.0 kitchen (3 out of 6) Sunday 2025/11/09# Introduce myself to the Kountry Kitchen and start helping out.\nDorado: \u0026ldquo;If you need hours, there is always something that needs doing around here.\u0026rdquo;\nActivity# 1:30PM - 4:30PM Instructed on how to restock cold drinks.

They seemed to have enough people so Mike F. thought I could be more useful elsewhere. The first task was to move some piles of plant trimmings to the organics bin, then I was assigned to clear dirt around a sprinkler control system that was at risk of being innundated by hillside erosion.\nSome shoveling later, I\u0026rsquo;ve given the sprinkler controls some elbow room.\nActivity# 8:30AM - 10:30AM (2 facility) Collect piles of trimmings and put them in organic waste bin 10:30AM - 3:00PM (minus lunch break = 4 facility) Shovel away dirt and rocks (eroded hill side) that threathened to bury the sprinkler control valves next to the member entrance booth.
