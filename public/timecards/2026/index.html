<p>Accepted Strawn&rsquo;s invitation to join in signal work today though I only got
to participate towards the end as I had an existing eye doctor&rsquo;s appointment.
Still, I got to help a bit and learned a lot doing it.</p>
<p>The biggest lesson of the day: all my past career skills trying to make sense
of poorly documented legacy code built up over decades will transfer directly
to making sense of poorly documented track signal wiring built up over
decades.</p>
<p>Past work have not necessarily been done with maintainability in mind, as
demonstrated by fasteners only accessible from below. Which today means we
would need to pull up the track segment to get to it. They likely built the
assembly while laying the track and plopped them into the ground together.
Not accounting for the possibility someone may need to service the switch
independently at a later date, like today.</p>
<p>History can also be found in wires that today goes nowhere and connect to
nothing, trying to tell me stories of projects past.</p>
<p>I had expected to see major differences between the components I&rsquo;ve used for
my indoor electronics projects and track signal equipment out in the
elements. Like extensive waterproofing to mitigate corrosion and
studious grounding to maintain signal integrity. I didn&rsquo;t see much of that at
first glance. I hope I&rsquo;m just overlooking mechanisms I don&rsquo;t yet recognize,
but if not maybe it is a contributing factor of signal reliability issues.</p>
<p>One thing I am confident of: there will be no shortage of work that needs
doing here.</p>

<p>Introduction to track signal system from Strawn. Included some history on both
technical and non-technical issues surrounding the signal system.</p>
<p>Cleaned up some of leaves built up overnight on water wheel, then turned on
water pump. Watched until I was satisfied the water flow closed the cycle
correctly.</p>
<p>Pre-run inspection walk for west track. Rodstein verified. Rock fall is
active: a big rock fell on the track in the time between my walk and Rodstein&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>No leaf blower on track today because somebody took the bucket of batteries. In
hindsight I should have gotten on the radio and asked who&rsquo;s got it. That&rsquo;s what
a radio is good for!</p>

<p>Safety meeting.</p>
<p>Conductor for Santa Fe Electric engineered by Cook. Handed off to Ames for my
lunch break. I took this opportunity to go thank Carolwood staff for being
friendly and waving to our guests.</p>

<p>Conductor for Rio Grande UP 1989 engineered by Nelson. A bit of unwelcome
excitement in the form of engine derailment at mausoleum when first axle of
second bogie went off track. Joked with guests this is an extended tour of
rail operations at no extra charge. Needed to disconnect engine from train
to put the engine back on the tracks. I learned that a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_%28railroad%29">powered slug</a>
would have made this particular derailment recovery much more difficult so it
was a good thing our engine was not configured as such.</p>
<p>Several pairs of eyes found no plausible explanation for derailment. Engine
went through the same location just fine afterwards. Shrug.</p>
<p>Handed off to Bickel to conduct a train with his family on board. He finished
off the day at that post.</p>

<p>Stopped in to shovel sediment out from water wheel reservoir so tomorrow&rsquo;s
Sunday public run can use the lower outlet pipe instead of filling up the
reservoir and spilling over the wall like last week.</p>
<p>Shoveling was easier than the last time I did it, partially because it hasn&rsquo;t
built back up as much and partially because I am getting more practiced at it.</p>
<p>The dirt is the functional concern, but the buildup of leaves was a secondary
appearance concern. I can clear out the dirt but, as the tree is actively
dropping leaves every time there&rsquo;s a breeze, clearing out all the leaves is
impossible. I can only make it better than it was.</p>
<p>Thick buildup of leaves on the structure before my work, a thin layer of fresh
leaves when I called it quits.</p>

<p>Track morning walk with leaf blower to clear loose leaves from track.
Also removed derailment risks like rocks, branches, and pine cones.
Since I had the leaf blower, finish my morning routine by clearing off
Sherwood station platform and guest entry area.</p>
<p>The water wheel feature is still a bit of a mess after recent rains. I found
the grate lifted, implying somebody was in the middle of a project.</p>

<p>After 11AM and no sign of McCabe, reached out via text message. Received
assignment: Reinstall grates, clear out whatever leaves are easy to clean,
then activate water wheel. Campbell helped execute this plan.</p>
<p>It took a while for water reservoir level to build up to flow over the wall.
The pump had to cycle on and off several times before reaching a state of
steady flow.</p>

<p>Work day! Good turnout means getting lots done alongside with general meeting
people and socializing.</p>
<p>Followed up with Paul Boschan about boilers. I should try to get my hands on
<a href="https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/bpvc-standards">ASME BPVC</a>
section 1. It sets up the basics and also define miniature boiler
which applies to scale steam models and locomotives.</p>

<p>Work began with a Nelson assigned task: plant some baby Blue Chalksticks
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curio_talinoides">Senecio Mandraliscae</a>)
to see how they do. Previous plant experiments got eaten by
park animals, hopefully they don&rsquo;t find these as delicious.</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-1-planting-in-progress.jpg" alt="Planting in progress" /></p>
<p>There are a few more holes in the weed cloth than there were plants. I filled
the middle leaving borders around. If these survive, we can either plant more
to fill out the perimeter or hope the plants will fill out.</p>

<p>Next up is a Finch assigned task to rake leaves. I accidentally gathered a
crew for this task as Bickel and Chu asked how they can help with work day.
Might as well invite them to join me!</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-3-rake-crew-progress.jpg" alt="Rake in progress" /></p>
<p>Three people working as a team cleared up leaves built up in front of the
two leaf-infested ground level tunnels. We finished up in time for lunch.</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-4-rake-crew-complete.jpg" alt="Rake complete" /></p>
<p>Lunch of tasty Mama Bear sandwiches and chatting with club members I have yet
to meet.</p>

<p>After lunch I was assistant for Perez project of setting up radio repeater.
There were a few minor misadventures including a lost &amp; found antenna cap
but it&rsquo;s nominally up and running. To test range I walked over to Bagley wall
while Perez walked to member entrance gate. Sounded really good!</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-5-radio-repeater-active.jpg" alt="Radio repeater" /></p>
<p>With the new repeater antenna active, the old antenna was coiled up. It will
be removed later but it stops being a trip hazard now.</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-6-trip-hazard-cord-coiled.jpg" alt="Old antenna coiled up" /></p>
<p>After radio project declared a success, took a break to chat with Perez and
Chu and Chu (father and son) about trains and the club. For driving large
brushed DC motors Perez recommends the
<a href="https://www.dimensionengineering.com/products/sabertooth2x32">Dimension Engineering Sabertooth 2x32 driver</a></p>
<p>After they departed for home I moved on to my solo project.</p>
<h4 id="330pm---600pm-25-facility">3:30PM - 6:00PM (2.5 facility)<a class="anchor" href="#330pm---600pm-25-facility">#</a></h4>
<p>At the board meeting Suncin asked for volunteers on several projects, I signed
up to remove rust from the old table saw. Suncin specified
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFM46FYS">Merryland Strip Disc</a>
for the job so I bought a pack and had it along with my angle grinder ready in
my car. I brought them to the rusty table saw surface.</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-7-table-saw-rusty.jpg" alt="Rusty table saw" /></p>
<p>The rust was more advanced than I had thought. It had grown beyond light
surface rust to having a pretty hardy black layer. The strip disc was up to
the task of removal but it wasn&rsquo;t as gentle as I hoped it would be. While
better than a steel wire brush, it still left swirls of a rotary power tool
at work. Nevertheless, the top flat surfaces are now rust-free.
The two guide channels and the guide bar itself are still rusty, as the
Merryland disc isn&rsquo;t the right shape to address those items.</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-8-table-saw-shiny.jpg" alt="Shiny table saw" /></p>
<p>This was a good place to pause, as I&rsquo;ve maxed out the daily work hours limit.
I found a quart of random motor oil in a cabinet. I applied a thin coat to
keep rust from immediately returning while I think about what to do next.</p>

<p>No public rides today due to rain, but stopped in to walk around the track in
reverse direction from what I&rsquo;ve been used to so far. Trying to imagine what
I would watch for to ensure passenger safety. No leaf blower today, but I did
pick up large branches as I went along.</p>
<p>Walking down mountain division eastward from water wheel, my left foot found
a sinkhole collapsing to nearly my knee. Thankfully I did not twist my ankle.</p>
<p><img src="./20260104-sinkhole-1-top.jpg" alt="Sinkhole discovery" /></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture showing its location relative to train storage barn.</p>
<p><img src="./20260104-sinkhole-2-context.jpg" alt="Sinkhole location context relative to barn" /></p>
<p>The hole is immediately above a water drain hole. Looks like dirt has been
draining out of that hole along with water.</p>

<p>To ensure my good intentions won&rsquo;t end up being counterproductive I consulted
with Nelson via text message. After confirmation I&rsquo;m good to go, I grabbed a
shovel and filled the hole back up with dirt conveniently at hand.</p>

<p>Since it&rsquo;s raining, things are still muddy. Will need to revisit after it
has a chance to dry and settle, but at least now it presents no risk to
anyone else&rsquo;s ankles.</p>
