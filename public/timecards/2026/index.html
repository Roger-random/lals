<p>Arrived at LALS to see the fabled &ldquo;Gold Rusher&rdquo; locomotive out for some
maintenance work. It gleamed beautifully in the morning light. I hope to see
it choo-choo down the rails at some point in all its shiny glory.</p>
<p><img src="./20260208_gold_rusher.jpg" alt="Gold Rusher Locomotive" /></p>
<p>I grabbed a leaf blower and walked the west loop. Noticed several pieces of
rusty debris in close proximity to each other but with no obvious source.
All rail within ~4&rsquo; in either direction looks fine to my eyes. Later Kristman
identified them as heavily corroded rail tie plates and associated fasteners.
I think I would have noticed missing tie plates so where did these come from?
Still a mystery.</p>
<p>The signal (KAB?) by the curved westbound rail leading to O&rsquo;Brien-Moore
bridge was correctly green as expected when I walked past. But later coming
back the other way, I happened to look over my shoulder and saw it was red
with no train. This may be related to that oddly dual-purposed rail segment
B-K2. For the moment I can only report it as a known false red to Strawn and
at the safety meeting to Sunday operations train engineers.</p>
<p>Helped Alexander restock the cold water refrigerator in the ticket booth.
Then figured I might as well stay on the theme and went over the Kountry
Kitchen beverage cooler as well. Several flats of drinks are now all in the
refrigerator, opening up storage shelf space.</p>
<p>While moving bottles towards the front, I found there&rsquo;s something brown and
sticky (Coca Cola? Pepsi? Dr. Pepper?) on the bottom. I wiped up the stainless
steel, and also bottoms of several cans that were sitting in that stuff.</p>
<p>Sent pictures of updated status (storage shelf, cooler left, cooler right)
to Dorado for his information.</p>
<p>Meeting up with friends for lunch today so departed at 1PM.</p>

<p>Met up with Strawn and Harper by panel K to see why signal light KD is dark.
An ultimately unsatisfying session because after probing some panels and wires
the light came back on without any intentional change on our part. Intermittent
connections make us tear our hair out.</p>
<p>While probing panel K, learned that a segment of rail (B-K2) has an associated
train presence detector board for signal purposes AND hooked up to another
detector that triggers a timer to control signal panel power. The timer
functionality is usually done by a short dedicated length of rail. What are
the tradeoffs between using dedicated rail versus dual-purposing like this?</p>
<p>Panel K is also unusual in having an always-on exhaust fan pushing warm air
out of the enclosure. This may be related to the timer board (since it needs
to stay on 24x7 to control whether the rest of the panel comes on) or it may
be due to the fact this panel gets a lot of sun exposure. New idea for the
project to-do list: add a rail side scenery facade building that also act as
panel K sun shade.</p>
<p>With some lessons learned about panel K and KD illuminated, attention moved on
to a rail switch motor control module in panel J. The new module is not an
identical drop-in replacement for the old so wiring verification and remapping
had to be done first. This was more difficult than it should be, partly due to
technical problems like a jumper wire that didn&rsquo;t actually jump, and to non-
technical issues like low blood sugar. Fix for the former: different jumper
wire. Fix for the latter: get lunch.</p>

<p>Continue panel J rail switch motor board replacement. Good news: the new board
sees user pressing on the rail side pole switch. Bad news: the new board isn&rsquo;t
commanding the MOSFET to send power to the motor. Without power the motor
doesn&rsquo;t turn and the switch doesn&rsquo;t get thrown.</p>
<p>I had to be out the gate by 3, Harper and Strawn continued working.</p>

<p>Helped Strawn with signal work.</p>
<p>Opened up the Sherwood station crossing signal boxes because they aren&rsquo;t
doing anything as if they don&rsquo;t have power. Tracing through the power
supply board, everything looks to be in order. That&rsquo;s when we noticed the
signals are now powered up. Hypothesis: there&rsquo;s an intermittent connection
somewhere in the power supply board, and it woke up when we were poking around
with a meter. Not fixed, but at least we&rsquo;ve narrowed it down and it&rsquo;s working
for now. I guess we can try wiggling the power board the next time it happens.</p>
<p>Moving on to panel G to diagnose missing red light on the signal bridge.
Flipping the light driver board to test mode, we saw it was not even
trying to illuminate red. Swapping out the board allowed red light to
illuminate. I performed this board swap as my first hands-on signal work and
I was supervised by no less than five other people. I feel important.</p>
<p>Next: why is it trying to show red light when there&rsquo;s no train? Found a busted
bond wire to replace and now signal bridge lights show red when there&rsquo;s a
train and green when there is not. Success!</p>
<p>Next up panel H. While waiting for Smith to arrive, probed to find current
mapping from rail segments to detector boards. Then consulted with Smith to
understand why there&rsquo;s a signal showing red and yellow simultaneously,
something that should never happen. Traced electrical behavior through rail
and found another bond wire to replace, but light is still showing both red
and yellow simultaneously. Smith will look at it some more.</p>
<p>While working on H, Strawn noticed light going up to Mountain Division is
indicating a train when there isn&rsquo;t one. This is new behavior within the past
few hours. Harper was working in that area in preparation for future work
and may have inadvertently damaged a feed wire. Fortunately it was quickly
diagnosed and repaired.</p>

<p>Two training laps on Santa Fe Electric with Ronne in the first car going over
things as we went. I had to articulate what track signals I see, explain what
I think they meant, and what I should do about it (if anything.) Also
included a few randomly called whistle stops for me to practice stopping
promptly without being jarring. Learning the throttle engagement
curve on SFE control knob feel a lot like learning a car manual transmission&rsquo;s
clutch engagement zone. Practice makes perfect!</p>
<p>Ronne thinks I&rsquo;m doing very well and on track towards my goal of getting
certified as an engineer on club engines for public runs. A good vote of
confidence as I work towards fulfilling other requirements.</p>

<p>Joined for a full day of signal work! Started by helping Strawn make panel I
talk to panel R so that a red signal in zone I will trigger the appropriate
yellow signal in zone R. Learned valuable lesson that these panel connections
have isolated ground wires. In hindsight it was something both of us should
have known.</p>
<p>After that success, moved on to panel S. I put my familiarity with leaf
blowers to work clearing out leaves to help see where wires already existed.
Once wires were located and identified, it didn&rsquo;t take long for Strawn and
Harper to restore power timer functionality. The timer module needs a bit of
programming to make it display a countdown and adjust the time span, this
is now on Strawn&rsquo;s to-do list.</p>
<p>On the way out to lunch, we noticed false red/red displaying for main line /
mountain division. Strawn and Harper agreed that should take priority over
what they had on their to-do list for the afternoon.</p>
<h4 id="200pm---445pm-275-facility">2:00PM - 4:45PM (2.75 facility)<a class="anchor" href="#200pm---445pm-275-facility">#</a></h4>
<p>After lunch Strawn opened up panel H to see why mountain division has a false
red/red. Found several error conditions that led to replacing two broken bond
wires and one broken track resistor. Unfortunately the light is still not
behaving quite right. Now the signal is green for main line, which is correct,
but mountain division light has both red and yellow illuminated even though
track voltage levels are consistent with a green. With wiring fixed and
voltage correct, the problem is likely somewhere within Smith proprietary
analog logic circuits.</p>
<p>We also found the both adjacent western blocks are completely unpowered with
zero train presence sensing voltage. Thus trains on those blocks are not being
tracked by the signal system. This has repercussions beyond today&rsquo;s scope of
work, will have to come back later.</p>
<p>After today&rsquo;s session I feel I can do some basic signal issue diagnosis using
a voltmeter, looking for 12-16VDC vs. 6-8VDC vs &lt;1V DC. Probably can&rsquo;t
fix anything without access to signal panels, but can gather information to
help make repairs faster.</p>
<p>For next session: bring ferrule crimp kit and bring iPad online with Test
Flight for the signal system reference app.</p>

<p>After Harper and Strawn departed, I went back to my solo project: club&rsquo;s old
table saw. I cleaned off the top surface on Jan 10th but the grinder-mounted
Merryland strip disc could not get into the pair of recessed guide rails so
they remained rusty.</p>
<p><img src="./20260127-table-saw-1-rusty-guide-rails.jpg" alt="Table saw rusty guides" /></p>
<p>Today I brought some drill-mounted steel wire wheels that I can use to clean
out those slots. Taking care not to (further) mar the top surface with those
steel bristles.</p>
<p><img src="./20260127-table-saw-2-rust-reduced-guide-rails.jpg" alt="Table saw less rusty guides" /></p>
<p>Once those were clean, I put the guide back into the slot and noticed it was
also covered with rust. Good thing I saw it while I have all my tools handy,
so I could make it all nice and shiny too.</p>
<p><img src="./20260127-table-saw-3-shiny-guide-bar.jpg" alt="Shiny table saw guide bar" /></p>
<p>After applying a coat of oil to keep rust from immediately returning, I am
content to call the table saw project done for now. Pending evaluation and
feedback for improvement.</p>

<p>Lots of leaves dropped on the water wheel feature. Blew and raked three
garbage cans worth of leaves for the organics bin while McCabe worked on the
debris screen. I wasn&rsquo;t confident I could put it back together so I hadn&rsquo;t
taken it apart in my previous work sessions. Today was the first time I could
watch McCabe take it apart, shovel accumulated dirt, and put it back together.
Now I can handle doing the same the next time I shovel out the reservoir.</p>
<p>Learned the fine mesh filter looped over the drain pipe exit were nylon sheer
knee-high socks. The old one was retired and a new one installed, with a few
extras available for the future.</p>
<p>After the water wheel was sorted out, took the leaf blower and walked the
west loop. Leaf clearing was easier because Tagochi had already done some
of it with a gas-powered blower. Usual rocks and branches, nothing major.</p>
<p>As I completed my west loop walk, Rodstein reported a problem with the east
loop: rails over a bridge were loose, moving as much as 1/4&quot; laterally which
is bad. I join the crew making an expedient field repair to steady the
rails for Sunday ride operation. A real fix will be needed later.</p>

<p>During lunch break, saw Jay Leno stop by with his White (that&rsquo;s the
brand name) steam car. Judging by its green color, I guess it is the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw2Tm9o6fiQ">1909 Model M featured in this video</a>.</p>
<p>Love that the thing was designed without an electrical system. Not just lack
of electronics: lack of electricity! No spark plugs, no ignition. All lights
are acetylene gas burning lamps, including the dashboard instrument light.</p>

<p>Saw that someone performed the experiment discussed at general member meeting.
I cautioned against using vinegar on corrosion concerns. Well, they were right
it would kill weeds, and I was right it greatly accelerated rail corrosion.
(And probably fasteners, switches, etc.)
I stand by my opinion rail condition is an important concern at a train club.</p>
<p>The pump house clock has been one hour off for several months, since the time
we were supposed to &ldquo;fall back&rdquo;. Alexander helped me adjust the clock so it
reads correctly again. That was an adventure but we should be able to
do it faster in a few weeks when we &ldquo;spring forward&rdquo;. Afterwards we were told
Harrison could do it quickly so I should ask him about it the next time I
see him.</p>
<p>Got a chance to look inside the club library, saw the collection included a few
out-of-print titles that I would be interested in digging into later. Including
Kozo Hiraoka&rsquo;s Climax and Pennsylvania A3 Switcher books.</p>
<p>Dinner at Tallyrand. They do a solid chicken fried steak.</p>

<p>Accepted Strawn&rsquo;s invitation to join in signal work today though I only got
to participate towards the end as I had an existing eye doctor&rsquo;s appointment.
Still, I got to help a bit and learned a lot doing it.</p>
<p>The biggest lesson of the day: all my past career skills trying to make sense
of poorly documented legacy code built up over decades will transfer directly
to making sense of poorly documented track signal wiring built up over
decades.</p>
<p>Past work have not necessarily been done with maintainability in mind, as
demonstrated by fasteners only accessible from below. Which today means we
would need to pull up the track segment to get to it. They likely built the
assembly while laying the track and plopped them into the ground together.
Not accounting for the possibility someone may need to service the switch
independently at a later date, like today.</p>
<p>History can also be found in wires that today goes nowhere and connect to
nothing, trying to tell me stories of projects past.</p>
<p>I had expected to see major differences between the components I&rsquo;ve used for
my indoor electronics projects and track signal equipment out in the
elements. Like extensive waterproofing to mitigate corrosion and
studious grounding to maintain signal integrity. I didn&rsquo;t see much of that at
first glance. I hope I&rsquo;m just overlooking mechanisms I don&rsquo;t yet recognize,
but if not maybe it is a contributing factor of signal reliability issues.</p>
<p>One thing I am confident of: there will be no shortage of work that needs
doing here.</p>

<p>No leaf blower on track today because somebody took the bucket of batteries. In
hindsight I should have gotten on the radio and asked who&rsquo;s got it. That&rsquo;s what
a radio is good for!</p>

<p>Conductor for Rio Grande UP 1989 engineered by Nelson. A bit of unwelcome
excitement in the form of engine derailment at mausoleum when first axle of
second bogie went off track. Joked with guests this is an extended tour of
rail operations at no extra charge. Needed to disconnect engine from train
to put the engine back on the tracks. I learned that a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_%28railroad%29">powered slug</a>
would have made this particular derailment recovery much more difficult so it
was a good thing our engine was not configured as such.</p>
<p>Several pairs of eyes found no plausible explanation for derailment. Engine
went through the same location just fine afterwards. Shrug.</p>
<p>Handed off to Bickel to conduct a train with his family on board. He finished
off the day at that post.</p>

<p>Stopped in to shovel sediment out from water wheel reservoir so tomorrow&rsquo;s
Sunday public run can use the lower outlet pipe instead of filling up the
reservoir and spilling over the wall like last week.</p>
<p>Shoveling was easier than the last time I did it, partially because it hasn&rsquo;t
built back up as much and partially because I am getting more practiced at it.</p>
<p>The dirt is the functional concern, but the buildup of leaves was a secondary
appearance concern. I can clear out the dirt but, as the tree is actively
dropping leaves every time there&rsquo;s a breeze, clearing out all the leaves is
impossible. I can only make it better than it was.</p>
<p>Thick buildup of leaves on the structure before my work, a thin layer of fresh
leaves when I called it quits.</p>

<p>Track morning walk with leaf blower to clear loose leaves from track.
Also removed derailment risks like rocks, branches, and pine cones.

<p>After lunch I was assistant for Perez project of setting up radio repeater.
There were a few minor misadventures including a lost &amp; found antenna cap
but it&rsquo;s nominally up and running. To test range I walked over to Bagley wall
while Perez walked to member entrance gate. Sounded really good!</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-5-radio-repeater-active.jpg" alt="Radio repeater" /></p>
<p>With the new repeater antenna active, the old antenna was coiled up. It will
be removed later but it stops being a trip hazard now.</p>

brushed DC motors Perez recommends the

<p>At the board meeting Suncin asked for volunteers on several projects, I signed
up to remove rust from the old table saw. Suncin specified
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFM46FYS">Merryland Strip Disc</a>
for the job so I bought a pack and had it along with my angle grinder ready in
my car. I brought them to the rusty table saw surface.</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-7-table-saw-rusty.jpg" alt="Rusty table saw" /></p>
<p>The rust was more advanced than I had thought. It had grown beyond light
surface rust to having a pretty hardy black layer. The strip disc was up to
the task of removal but it wasn&rsquo;t as gentle as I hoped it would be. While
better than a steel wire brush, it still left swirls of a rotary power tool
at work. Nevertheless, the top flat surfaces are now rust-free.
The two guide channels and the guide bar itself are still rusty, as the
Merryland disc isn&rsquo;t the right shape to address those items.</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-8-table-saw-shiny.jpg" alt="Shiny table saw" /></p>
<p>This was a good place to pause, as I&rsquo;ve maxed out the daily work hours limit.
I found a quart of random motor oil in a cabinet. I applied a thin coat to
keep rust from immediately returning while I think about what to do next.</p>

<p>No public rides today due to rain, but stopped in to walk around the track in
reverse direction from what I&rsquo;ve been used to so far. Trying to imagine what
I would watch for to ensure passenger safety. No leaf blower today, but I did
pick up large branches as I went along.</p>
<p>Walking down mountain division eastward from water wheel, my left foot found
a sinkhole collapsing to nearly my knee. Thankfully I did not twist my ankle.</p>
<p><img src="./20260104-sinkhole-1-top.jpg" alt="Sinkhole discovery" /></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture showing its location relative to train storage barn.</p>
<p><img src="./20260104-sinkhole-2-context.jpg" alt="Sinkhole location context relative to barn" /></p>
<p>The hole is immediately above a water drain hole. Looks like dirt has been
draining out of that hole along with water.</p>
<p><img src="./20260104-sinkhole-3-drain.jpg" alt="Drainage hole" /></p>
<p>To ensure my good intentions won&rsquo;t end up being counterproductive I consulted
with Nelson via text message. After confirmation I&rsquo;m good to go, I grabbed a
shovel and filled the hole back up with dirt conveniently at hand.</p>
<p><img src="./20260104-sinkhole-4-filling.jpg" alt="Hastily filled sinkhole" /></p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s raining, things are still muddy. Will need to revisit after it
has a chance to dry and settle, but at least now it presents no risk to
anyone else&rsquo;s ankles.</p>
