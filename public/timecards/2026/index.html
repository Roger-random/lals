<p>Work day! Good turnout means getting lots done alongside with general meeting
people and socializing.</p>
<p>Followed up with Paul Boschan about boilers. I should try to get my hands on
<a href="https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/bpvc-standards">ASME BPVC</a>
section 1. It sets up the basics and also define miniature boiler
which applies to scale steam models and locomotives.</p>
<h4 id="900am---1000am-1-facility">9:00AM - 10:00AM (1 facility)<a class="anchor" href="#900am---1000am-1-facility">#</a></h4>
<p>Work began with a Nelson assigned task: plant some baby Blue Chalksticks
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curio_talinoides">Senecio Mandraliscae</a>)
to see how they do. Previous plant experiments got eaten by
park animals, hopefully they don&rsquo;t find these as delicious.</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-1-planting-in-progress.jpg" alt="Planting in progress" /></p>
<p>There are a few more holes in the weed cloth than there were plants. I filled
the middle leaving borders around. If these survive, we can either plant more
to fill out the perimeter or hope the plants will fill out.</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-2-planting-complete.jpg" alt="Planting complete" /></p>

<p>Next up is a Finch assigned task to rake leaves. I accidentally gathered a
crew for this task as Bickel and Chu asked how they can help with work day.
Might as well invite them to join me!</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-3-rake-crew-progress.jpg" alt="Rake in progress" /></p>
<p>Three people working as a team cleared up leaves built up in front of the
two leaf-infested ground level tunnels. We finished up in time for lunch.</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-4-rake-crew-complete.jpg" alt="Rake complete" /></p>
<p>Lunch of tasty Mama Bear sandwiches and chatting with club members I have yet
to meet.</p>
<h4 id="100pm---245pm-175-facility">1:00PM - 2:45PM (1.75 facility)<a class="anchor" href="#100pm---245pm-175-facility">#</a></h4>
<p>After lunch I was assistant for Perez project of setting up radio repeater.
There were a few minor misadventures including a lost &amp; found antenna cap
but it&rsquo;s nominally up and running. To test range I walked over to Bagley wall
while Perez walked to member entrance gate. Sounded really good!</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-5-radio-repeater-active.jpg" alt="Radio repeater" /></p>
<p>With the new repeater antenna active, the old antenna was coiled up. It will
be removed later but it stops being a trip hazard now.</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-6-trip-hazard-cord-coiled.jpg" alt="Old antenna coiled up" /></p>
<p>After radio project declared a success, took a break to chat with Perez and
Chu and Chu (father and son) about trains and the club. For driving large
brushed DC motors Perez recommends the
<a href="https://www.dimensionengineering.com/products/sabertooth2x32">Dimension Engineering Sabertooth 2x32 driver</a></p>
<p>After they departed for home I moved on to my solo project.</p>
<h4 id="330pm---600pm-25-facility">3:30PM - 6:00PM (2.5 facility)<a class="anchor" href="#330pm---600pm-25-facility">#</a></h4>
<p>At the board meeting Suncin asked for volunteers on several projects, I signed
up to remove rust from the old table saw. Suncin specified
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFM46FYS">Merryland Strip Disc</a>
for the job so I bought a pack and had it along with my angle grinder ready in
my car. I brought them to the rusty table saw surface.</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-7-table-saw-rusty.jpg" alt="Rusty table saw" /></p>
<p>The rust was more advanced than I had thought. It had grown beyond light
surface rust to having a pretty hardy black layer. The strip disc was up to
the task of removal but it wasn&rsquo;t as gentle as I hoped it would be. While
better than a steel wire brush, it still left swirls of a rotary power tool
at work. Nevertheless, the top flat surfaces are now rust-free.
The two guide channels and the guide bar itself are still rusty, as the
Merryland disc isn&rsquo;t the right shape to address those items.</p>
<p><img src="./20260110-work-day-8-table-saw-shiny.jpg" alt="Shiny table saw" /></p>
<p>This was a good place to pause, as I&rsquo;ve maxed out the daily work hours limit.
I found a quart of random motor oil in a cabinet. I applied a thin coat to
keep rust from immediately returning while I think about what to do next.</p>
<h2 id="sunday-202614">Sunday 2026/1/4<a class="anchor" href="#sunday-202614">#</a></h2>
<p>No public rides today due to rain, but stopped in to walk around the track in
reverse direction from what I&rsquo;ve been used to so far. Trying to imagine what
I would watch for to ensure passenger safety. No leaf blower today, but I did
pick up large branches as I went along.</p>
<p>Walking down mountain division eastward from water wheel, my left foot found
a sinkhole collapsing to nearly my knee. Thankfully I did not twist my ankle.</p>
<p><img src="./20260104-sinkhole-1-top.jpg" alt="Sinkhole discovery" /></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture showing its location relative to train storage barn.</p>
<p><img src="./20260104-sinkhole-2-context.jpg" alt="Sinkhole location context relative to barn" /></p>
<p>The hole is immediately above a water drain hole. Looks like dirt has been
draining out of that hole along with water.</p>
<p><img src="./20260104-sinkhole-3-drain.jpg" alt="Drainage hole" /></p>
<p>To ensure my good intentions won&rsquo;t end up being counterproductive I consulted
with Nelson via text message. After confirmation I&rsquo;m good to go, I grabbed a
shovel and filled the hole back up with dirt conveniently at hand.</p>
<p><img src="./20260104-sinkhole-4-filling.jpg" alt="Hastily filled sinkhole" /></p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s raining, things are still muddy. Will need to revisit after it
has a chance to dry and settle, but at least now it presents no risk to
anyone else&rsquo;s ankles.</p>
