Trying to imagine what I would watch for to ensure passenger safety. No leaf blower today, but I did pick up large branches as I went along.\nWalking down mountain division eastward from water wheel, my left foot found a sinkhole collapsing to nearly my knee. Thankfully I did not twist my ankle.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a picture showing its location relative to train storage barn.\nThe hole is immediately above a water drain hole. Looks like dirt has been draining out of that hole along with water.\nTo ensure my good intentions won\u0026rsquo;t end up being counterproductive I consulted with Nelson via text message. After confirmation I\u0026rsquo;m good to go, I grabbed a shovel and filled the hole back up with dirt conveniently at hand.\nSince it\u0026rsquo;s raining, things are still muddy. Will need to revisit after it has a chance to dry and settle, but at least now it presents no risk to anyone else\u0026rsquo;s ankles.\nActivity# 9:00AM - 10:00AM (1.0 hrs facility) Put large branches on main line in organics bin.

(Fail)\nI thought I would complete probationary requirements today but when I double checked records I found I double-counted conductor hours on 12/7. So instead of a few hours over, I\u0026rsquo;m actually a bit short. I made this mistake because I had been writing down name of the engineer of train I was conducting. This system broke down when Ronne and Rodstein traded off engineering Santa Fe Electric on 12/7. Which meant my \u0026ldquo;conductor for Ronne\u0026rdquo; hours and \u0026ldquo;conductor for Rodstein\u0026rdquo; hours were actually the same hours. Lesson learned, note-keeping system will evolve!\nMorning walk found a broken sprinkler cap just east of covered bridge. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t find matching broken pipe. Informed Nelson and Harper, Harper says he\u0026rsquo;ll look into it.\nTook Santa Fe Electric for a no-passenger full lap under Cammarata supervision. I will need to study signals further and get more experience watching the points on switches.\nLunch options tamales or skirt steak.\nJay Leno stopped by with Doble E-20 steam car and filled up on boiler water.\nActivity# 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 hrs facility) Leaf blower ticket/line area and train platform.

We had Santa, we had Grinch!\nMurphy brought Baofeng configuration equipment and set me up so I can use my own radio.\nMet another Roger. T and C sounded too similar over radio, though, so I pronounced my last name instead of just initial.\nShawn brought and ran a Roger Goldmann (of original livesteamlocomotives.com) designed 2-8-0 steam locomotive pulling public rides.\nBoschan brought and ran a small steam locomotive that fit in the trunk of a Honda Civic, a reassuringly accessible size! Boschan works professionally in a heat exchanger fabrication company, and offered to answer questions about building boilers when I reach that point. The little locomotive is an articulated 2-4-4-2 modeled after the Columbia River Belt Line 7 a.k.a.

It\u0026rsquo;s going to be a busy day. Kallgren said I just missed Jay Leno and his Chrysler Turbine car by less than 15 minutes. That would have been awesome. Ah well.\nKountry Kitchen seating area was getting pretty cluttered with pine cones and needles. Somebody needs to clean it up and today that somebody is me.\nSimilar buildup around the adjacent caboose.\nRinsed off Carolwood driveway.

Today my train engineer had an extra radio I could use so I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to check out a club radio.\nLiz ran her Allen 2-6-0 Mogul steam locomotive around the track during public run hours. Guests were entertained. Towards the end of the day shortly after our public train left the station, we ran parallel to her train climbing up towards Davis mine. I had a clear view through her locomotive running gear and can see Stephenson valve eccentrics working away. Oh yeah! THIS is why I am here!\nActivity# 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 facility) Water wheel mesh cleanup \u0026amp; startup. Leaf blower cleaning around Sherwood station. Sherwood station umbrella raising. 10:45AM - 4:00PM (5.25 - 0.5 lunch = 4.75 conducting) Conduct for Blake in Santa Fe Electric. That was a long ass day!

This made guests happy and I was happy to see and hear it run.\nLiz fired up her Allen Models of Nevada 2-6-0 Mogul coal-burning(!) steam locomotive but unfortunately some misplaced rods meant she couldn\u0026rsquo;t run it. Liz was very friendly and answered questions as I watched her go through procedure to shut her engine back down for the night.\nLiz loves the K-27 locomotive, specificially engine 463, and was very excited to hear I\u0026rsquo;m contemplating building Kozo Hiraoka\u0026rsquo;s K-27. Sounds like I\u0026rsquo;ll have an appreciative fan if I go make one a 463.\nSince we were on the topic of favorite locomotives, I expressed my eventual goal is to have a 4-8-4 Northern. Preferably the Santa Fe 3751 but I would not complain about Santa Fe 2926. In response Nick G. answered his favorite Northern was the Southern Pacific 4360. Quick internet search says this is a MT-3 class 4-8-2 Mountain. Did I get the wrong one? Ask Nick later.\nActivity# 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 facility) Water wheel mesh cleanup \u0026amp; startup Heavy pine needle buildup around Sherwood station required broom cleanup Leaf blowered lightweight remainder around Sherwood Raise umbrellas 10:45AM - 3:15PM (4.5 conducting) Conduct for Ronne/Rodstein in Santa Fe Electric 3:15PM - 3:30PM (0.25 facility) Water wheel shut down Lower umbrellas Tally# 7 hours total 2.5 facility (19.25 out of 18) 4.5 conducting (9 out of 18) 0.0 kitchen (3 out of 6) Saturday 2025/12/06# Joined Nelson\u0026rsquo;s Bagley Wall crew in the morning, then stayed around for additional independent facility work in the afternoon. Dorado tri-tip is very tasty, hope I\u0026rsquo;ll get more of it in the future.\nBagley wall work anticipated some roots may have grown behind the wall, but they were far beefier than expected putting up a terrific fight. We even had a few battles where wood triumphed over metal tools. I can see how this growth exerted pressure making Bagley wall lean in.\nWater wheel reservoir collected quite a bit of sediment after recent storm so I started shoveling them out.\nBefore/after view of the reservoir wall.\nBefore/after view of the reservoir underneath rail bridge.\nWe also had quite a few leaves drop on rail layout. I can\u0026rsquo;t do the whole layout by myself in a day, but I can pick a section and make it better.\nNone of this will last, of course. Mother nature always wins in the end. All we can do is to have it look nicer for a little bit.\nActivity# 8:30AM - 11:45AM (3.25 facility) Bagley wall disassembly Set new vertical posts in concrete 1:15PM - 2:45PM (1.5 facility) Shovel sediment buildup out of waterwheel reservoir 3:15PM - 5:15PM (2 facility) Rake leaves from multilane track adjacent to steaming bays, west of Sutchville station.

Rick\u0026rsquo;s got a Audi TDI with DR GROSS plate. Russ has a big truck and that\u0026rsquo;s not a tow hitch in the back: it\u0026rsquo;s a train coupler. Cool!\nTrees on the west end have started bearing fruit. Not ripe enough for eating but big and heavy enough to droop down within reach of public ride passengers. Several passengers on trains I conducted this past Sunday pantomimed reaching to pick fruit. This is not good. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit sad to waste food but safety is paramount. I lopped off the literal low-hanging fruit to remove the temptation.\nThe driveway leading up to Carolwood barn collected quite the layer of mud during recent storm. I don\u0026rsquo;t like how it looks and I don\u0026rsquo;t think guests will want to walk over caked mud.\nThis is what I could do with shovel and broom. I think I need a pressure washer or something to rinse off the final fine layer. But at least there\u0026rsquo;s no sinking guest shoes into mud anymore.\nActivity# 2:00PM - 4:30PM (Subtract Rick/Russ chat time = 2.0 facility) Lopped off grapefruit tree branches that had grown too close to track. Trimmed other potential forehead-smackers on western end. Shoveled thick (~1\u0026quot;) layer of caked mud out of Disney barn entrance ramp.

Tour by Anthony who just barely missed being able to run it when it broke down nearly a year ago.\nChatted with Eber and Nick G. about 3.5\u0026quot; gauge steam engines. I consider myself properly warned that smaller engines are more challenging to run smoothly due to smaller margins in maintaining proper level of fire and water.\nActivity# 3:15PM - 3:45PM (0.5 facility) Help with end-of-day teardown Lower umbrellas Help put passenger cars away Tally# 0.5 hours total 0.5 facility (6.5 out of 18) 0.0 conducting (0 out of 18) 0.0 kitchen (3 out of 6) Sunday 2025/11/09# Introduce myself to the Kountry Kitchen and start helping out.\nDorado: \u0026ldquo;If you need hours, there is always something that needs doing around here.\u0026rdquo;\nActivity# 1:30PM - 4:30PM Instructed on how to restock cold drinks.

Now GET TO WORK!\nThere was a crew removing a switch and track that had gone unused and caused more problems than it was worth. They seemed to have enough people so Mike F. thought I could be more useful elsewhere. The first task was to move some piles of plant trimmings to the organics bin, then I was assigned to clear dirt around a sprinkler control system that was at risk of being innundated by hillside erosion.\nSome shoveling later, I\u0026rsquo;ve given the sprinkler controls some elbow room.\nActivity# 8:30AM - 10:30AM (2 facility) Collect piles of trimmings and put them in organic waste bin 10:30AM - 3:00PM (minus lunch break = 4 facility) Shovel away dirt and rocks (eroded hill side) that threathened to bury the sprinkler control valves next to the member entrance booth.
