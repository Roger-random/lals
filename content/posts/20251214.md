**Notes**

Liz ran her Allen Models of Nevada 2-6-0 Mogul coal-fired(!) steam locomotive
around the track during public run hours. Guests were entertained.

Liz loves the K-27 locomotive, specificially
[engine 463](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_463),
and was very excited to hear I'm contemplating building Kozo Hiraoka's K-27.
Sounds like I'll have an appreciative fan if I go make one a 463.
