**Objective**

Work towards building conductor hours.

**Notes**

Plan: After completing conductor training with Andrew Chavez, I came to see if I
can get a few ride-alongs and maybe a check ride.

Actual: "You finished the class?" "Yeah." "You passed the test?" "Yeah, 9/10."
"You're conducting today."

Normally I would talk to engineers to find out who needs a conductor, but today
is different because of an unexpected shortage of conductors resulted in some
shuffling and reassignment by safety coordinators.

**Activity Log**

* 6.0 hours total
  * 1.5 facility (8 out of 18)
  * 4.5 conducting (4.5 out of 18)
  * 0.0 kitchen (3 out of 6)

* 8:30AM - 10:00AM (1.5 facility)
  * Water wheel mesh cleanup and startup
  * Leaf blower around Sherwood station
  * Raise umbrella
* 10:45AM - 3:45PM (minus lunch = 4.5 conducting)
  * Conduct for Matthew Bassett in SPPA
  * Unexpectedly ran out of fuel in afternoon, eventually traced to fuel leak.
