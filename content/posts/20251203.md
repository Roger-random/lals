**Objective**

Was in the area and had a few hours to spare, stopped in for some facility work.

Met Rick and Russ(?) as they sorted through their inventory in the storage
unit adjacent to elevated Gauge-1 layout. Rick's got a Audi TDI with DR GROSS
plate. Russ has a big truck and that's not a tow hitch in the back: it's a
train coupler. Cool!
