## Objective

Learn what happens during Sunday public ride operations.

## Notes

Listened to several conductors' safety speeches.

One ride-along with McCabe conducting.

I got to see the fabled Engine No. 8, club-owned steam locomotive. Tour
by Anthony who just barely missed being able to run it when it broke down
nearly a year ago.

Chatted with Eber and Nick G. about 3.5" gauge steam engines. I consider
myself properly warned that smaller engines are more challenging to run
smoothly due to smaller margins in maintaining proper level of fire and water.
