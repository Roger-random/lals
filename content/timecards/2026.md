## Sunday 2026/1/4

No public rides today due to rain, but stopped in to walk around the track in
reverse direction from what I've been used to so far. Trying to imagine what
I would watch for to ensure passenger safety. No leaf blower today, but I did
pick up large branches as I went along.

Walking down mountain division eastward from water wheel, my left foot found
a sinkhole collapsing to nearly my knee. Thankfully no twisted ankle. After
consulting with Nelson via text message, I grabbed a shovel and filled the
hole back up with dirt conveniently at hand. Since it's raining, the dirt
is partially mud. Will need to revisit after it has a chance to dry and
settle, but at least now it presents no risk to anyone else's ankles.
