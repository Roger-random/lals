## Sunday 2026/1/11

* 4.25 hours total
  * 3 facility (45 out of 18)
  * 1.25 conductor (17.75 out of 18)
  * 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6)

#### 8:30AM - 10:45AM (2.25 facility)

Track morning walk with leaf blower to clear loose leaves from track.
Also removed derailment risks like rocks, branches, and pine cones.
Since I had the leaf blower, finish my morning routine by clearing off
Sherwood station platform and guest entry area.

The water wheel feature is still a bit of a mess after recent rains. I found
the grate lifted, implying somebody was in the middle of a project.

#### 10:45AM - 11:00AM (0.25 conductor)

Train crew safety meeting. Three trains had their engineers and conductors
so I'm relief conductor on an as-needed bases. Frees me up to go back
and look at the water wheel.

#### 11:00AM - 11:45AM (0.75 facility)

After 11AM and no sign of McCabe, reached out via text message. Received
assignment: Reinstall grates, clear out whatever leaves are easy to clean,
then activate water wheel. Campbell helped execute this plan.

It took a while for water reservoir level to build up to flow over the wall.
The pump had to cycle on and off several times before reaching a state of
steady flow.

#### 1:45PM - 2:45PM (1.00 conductor)

Late in the afternoon I conducted Fuad's train for an hour then helped put
the bench cars and the engine away at the end of the day.

#### 3:15PM

Turned off water wheel electric power and water valve. See what the reservoir
looks like next time.

## Saturday 2026/1/10

* 7.5 hours total
  * 7.5 facility (42 out of 18)
  * 0 conductor (16.5 out of 18)
  * 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6)

Work day! Good turnout means getting lots done alongside with general meeting
people and socializing.

Followed up with Paul Boschan about boilers. I should try to get my hands on
[ASME BPVC](https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/bpvc-standards)
section 1. It sets up the basics and also define miniature boiler
which applies to scale steam models and locomotives.

#### 9:00AM - 10:00AM (1 facility)

Work began with a Nelson assigned task: plant some baby Blue Chalksticks
([Senecio Mandraliscae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curio_talinoides))
to see how they do. Previous plant experiments got eaten by
park animals, hopefully they don't find these as delicious.

![Planting in progress](./20260110-work-day-1-planting-in-progress.jpg)

There are a few more holes in the weed cloth than there were plants. I filled
the middle leaving borders around. If these survive, we can either plant more
to fill out the perimeter or hope the plants will fill out.

![Planting complete](./20260110-work-day-2-planting-complete.jpg)

#### 10:00AM - 12:15PM (2.25 facility)

Next up is a Finch assigned task to rake leaves. I accidentally gathered a
crew for this task as Bickel and Chu asked how they can help with work day.
Might as well invite them to join me!

![Rake in progress](./20260110-work-day-3-rake-crew-progress.jpg)

Three people working as a team cleared up leaves built up in front of the
two leaf-infested ground level tunnels. We finished up in time for lunch.

![Rake complete](./20260110-work-day-4-rake-crew-complete.jpg)

Lunch of tasty Mama Bear sandwiches and chatting with club members I have yet
to meet.

#### 1:00PM - 2:45PM (1.75 facility)

After lunch I was assistant for Perez project of setting up radio repeater.
There were a few minor misadventures including a lost & found antenna cap
but it's nominally up and running. To test range I walked over to Bagley wall
while Perez walked to member entrance gate. Sounded really good!

![Radio repeater](./20260110-work-day-5-radio-repeater-active.jpg)

With the new repeater antenna active, the old antenna was coiled up. It will
be removed later but it stops being a trip hazard now.

![Old antenna coiled up](./20260110-work-day-6-trip-hazard-cord-coiled.jpg)

After radio project declared a success, took a break to chat with Perez and
Chu and Chu (father and son) about trains and the club. For driving large
brushed DC motors Perez recommends the
[Dimension Engineering Sabertooth 2x32 driver](https://www.dimensionengineering.com/products/sabertooth2x32)

After they departed for home I moved on to my solo project.

#### 3:30PM - 6:00PM (2.5 facility)

At the board meeting Suncin asked for volunteers on several projects, I signed
up to remove rust from the old table saw. Suncin specified
[Merryland Strip Disc](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFM46FYS)
for the job so I bought a pack and had it along with my angle grinder ready in
my car. I brought them to the rusty table saw surface.

![Rusty table saw](./20260110-work-day-7-table-saw-rusty.jpg)

The rust was more advanced than I had thought. It had grown beyond light
surface rust to having a pretty hardy black layer. The strip disc was up to
the task of removal but it wasn't as gentle as I hoped it would be. While
better than a steel wire brush, it still left swirls of a rotary power tool
at work. Nevertheless, the top flat surfaces are now rust-free.
The two guide channels and the guide bar itself are still rusty, as the
Merryland disc isn't the right shape to address those items.

![Shiny table saw](./20260110-work-day-8-table-saw-shiny.jpg)

This was a good place to pause, as I've maxed out the daily work hours limit.
I found a quart of random motor oil in a cabinet. I applied a thin coat to
keep rust from immediately returning while I think about what to do next.

## Sunday 2026/1/4

No public rides today due to rain, but stopped in to walk around the track in
reverse direction from what I've been used to so far. Trying to imagine what
I would watch for to ensure passenger safety. No leaf blower today, but I did
pick up large branches as I went along.

Walking down mountain division eastward from water wheel, my left foot found
a sinkhole collapsing to nearly my knee. Thankfully I did not twist my ankle.

![Sinkhole discovery](./20260104-sinkhole-1-top.jpg)

Here's a picture showing its location relative to train storage barn.

![Sinkhole location context relative to barn](./20260104-sinkhole-2-context.jpg)

The hole is immediately above a water drain hole. Looks like dirt has been
draining out of that hole along with water.

![Drainage hole](./20260104-sinkhole-3-drain.jpg)

To ensure my good intentions won't end up being counterproductive I consulted
with Nelson via text message. After confirmation I'm good to go, I grabbed a
shovel and filled the hole back up with dirt conveniently at hand.

![Hastily filled sinkhole](./20260104-sinkhole-4-filling.jpg)

Since it's raining, things are still muddy. Will need to revisit after it
has a chance to dry and settle, but at least now it presents no risk to
anyone else's ankles.
