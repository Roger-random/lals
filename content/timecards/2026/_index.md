## Sunday 2026/1/4

No public rides today due to rain, but stopped in to walk around the track in
reverse direction from what I've been used to so far. Trying to imagine what
I would watch for to ensure passenger safety. No leaf blower today, but I did
pick up large branches as I went along.

Walking down mountain division eastward from water wheel, my left foot found
a sinkhole collapsing to nearly my knee. Thankfully I did not twist my ankle.

Here's a picture showing its location relative to train storage barn.

The hole is immediately above a water drain hole. Looks like dirt has been
draining out of that hole along with water.

To ensure my good intentions won't end up being counterproductive I consulted
with Nelson via text message. After confirmation I'm good to go, I grabbed a
shovel and filled the hole back up with dirt conveniently at hand.

Since it's raining, things are still muddy. Will need to revisit after it
has a chance to dry and settle, but at least now it presents no risk to
anyone else's ankles.
