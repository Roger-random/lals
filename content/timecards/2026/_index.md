## Saturday 2026/1/10

* 7.5 hours total
  * 7.5 facility (42 out of 18)
  * 0 conductor (16.5 out of 18)
  * 0 kitchen (7.75 out of 6)

Work day! Good turnout means getting lots done alongside with general meeting
people and socializing.

Followed up with Paul Boschan about boilers. I should try to get my hands on
[ASME BPVC](https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/bpvc-standards)
section 1. It sets up the basics and also define miniature boiler
which applies to scale steam models and locomotives.

#### 9:00AM - 10:00AM (1 facility)

Work began with a Nelson assigned task: plant some baby Blue Chalksticks
([Senecio Mandraliscae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curio_talinoides))
to see how they do. Previous plant experiments got eaten by
park animals, hopefully they don't find these as delicious.

There are a few more holes in the weed cloth than there were plants. I filled
the middle leaving borders around. If these survive, we can either plant more
to fill out the perimeter or hope the plants will fill out.

#### 10:00AM - 12:15PM (2.25 facility)

Next up is a Finch assigned task to rake leaves. I accidentally gathered a
crew for this task as Bickel and Chu asked how they can help with work day.
Might as well invite them to join me!

Three people working as a team cleared up leaves built up in front of the
two leaf-infested ground level tunnels. We finished up in time for lunch.

Lunch of tasty Mama Bear sandwiches and chatting with club members I have yet
to meet.

#### 1:00PM - 2:45PM (1.75 facility)

After lunch I was assistant for Perez project of setting up radio repeater.
There were a few minor misadventures including a lost & found antenna cap
but it's nominally up and running. To test range I walked over to Bagley wall
while Perez walked to member entrance gate. Sounded really good!

With the new repeater antenna active, the old antenna was coiled up. It will
be removed later but it stops being a trip hazard now.

After radio project declared a success, took a break to chat with Perez and
Chu and Chu (father and son) about trains and the club. For driving large
brushed DC motors Perez recommends the
[Dimension Engineering Sabertooth 2x32 driver](https://www.dimensionengineering.com/products/sabertooth2x32)

After they departed for home I moved on to my solo project.

#### 3:30PM - 6:00PM (2.5 facility)

At the board meeting Suncin asked for volunteers on several projects, I signed
up to remove rust from the old table saw. Suncin specified
[Merryland Strip Disc](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFM46FYS)
for the job so I bought a pack and had it along with my angle grinder ready in
my car. I brought them to the rusty table saw surface.

![Rusty table saw](./20260110-work-day-7-table-saw-rusty.jpg)

The rust was more advanced than I had thought. It had grown beyond light
surface rust to having a pretty hardy black layer. The strip disc was up to
the task of removal but it wasn't as gentle as I hoped it would be. While
better than a steel wire brush, it still left swirls of a rotary power tool
at work. Nevertheless, the top flat surfaces are now rust-free.
The two guide channels and the guide bar itself are still rusty, as the
Merryland disc isn't the right shape to address those items.

![Shiny table saw](./20260110-work-day-8-table-saw-shiny.jpg)

This was a good place to pause, as I've maxed out the daily work hours limit.
I found a quart of random motor oil in a cabinet. I applied a thin coat to
keep rust from immediately returning while I think about what to do next.

## Sunday 2026/1/4

No public rides today due to rain, but stopped in to walk around the track in
reverse direction from what I've been used to so far. Trying to imagine what
I would watch for to ensure passenger safety. No leaf blower today, but I did
pick up large branches as I went along.

Walking down mountain division eastward from water wheel, my left foot found
a sinkhole collapsing to nearly my knee. Thankfully I did not twist my ankle.

![Sinkhole discovery](./20260104-sinkhole-1-top.jpg)

Here's a picture showing its location relative to train storage barn.

![Sinkhole location context relative to barn](./20260104-sinkhole-2-context.jpg)

The hole is immediately above a water drain hole. Looks like dirt has been
draining out of that hole along with water.

![Drainage hole](./20260104-sinkhole-3-drain.jpg)

To ensure my good intentions won't end up being counterproductive I consulted
with Nelson via text message. After confirmation I'm good to go, I grabbed a
shovel and filled the hole back up with dirt conveniently at hand.

![Hastily filled sinkhole](./20260104-sinkhole-4-filling.jpg)

Since it's raining, things are still muddy. Will need to revisit after it
has a chance to dry and settle, but at least now it presents no risk to
anyone else's ankles.
