Goal:

Become a member of Los Angeles Live Steamers. I want to watch people
playing with their 7.5" gauge trains, and buid up towards a train of my own.
This is a volunteer-run organization so I'm going to jump right in!
My contributions will be tracked on my [timecard log](./timecards)

Anecdote:

Roger: "Does LALS have a groundskeeping staff?"

Answer: "Yes it does! It's you. Welcome to the groundkeeping staff and also
everything else staff."
